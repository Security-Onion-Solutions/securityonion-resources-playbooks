name: "ET DYN_DNS Category Playbook"
id: 1200003
description: |
    This playbook is designed to help investigate alerts from the ET DYN_DNS category, which focuses on detecting the use of dynamic DNS services. These services (including No-IP, DynDNS, and others) allow users to map domains to changing IP addresses. While they have legitimate uses such as hosting game servers, remote access solutions, and home labs, they are frequently abused by threat actors for malicious purposes including C2 infrastructure, phishing sites, and malware distribution. The rules in this category detect both DNS queries and HTTP requests to known dynamic DNS providers, as well as specific client software associated with these services.
