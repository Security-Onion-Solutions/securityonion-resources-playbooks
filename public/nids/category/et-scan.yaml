name: ET SCAN Category Playbook
id: 1600003
description: |
  This playbook is designed to help investigate alerts from the ET SCAN category, which detects various types of network reconnaissance and scanning activities including:
  - Network mapping tools (e.g., Nmap TCP SYN/ACK/FIN scans)
  - Service-specific scanners (e.g., SIPVicious for VoIP, DavTest for WebDAV)
  - Vulnerability assessment tools (e.g., Amap service detection)
  - Brute force attempts (SSH, FTP, etc.)
  - OS fingerprinting attempts (e.g., Xprobe2)
  - Protocol-specific enumeration (UPNP, DCERPC, H.323)
  These rules help identify both targeted reconnaissance and broader network scanning campaigns that could indicate preparation for more focused attacks.

questions:
- question: Is the scanning system a known-good system?
  context: Known-good systems may be authorized vulnerability scanners or maintenance tools.

- question: What type of scan is being detected?
  context: Different scan types (e.g., service enumeration, vulnerability scan, reconnaissance) give context to the type of activity being detected.
  answer_sources:
  - alert
  query: |
    aggregation: false
    logsource:
      category: alert
      product: suricata

        - src_ip
        - src_port
        - dst_ip
        - dst_port
- question: Is this part of a broader scanning campaign?
  context: Multiple scan attempts from the same source across different targets or services may indicate a systematic reconnaissance effort.
  answer_sources:
  - alert

    aggregation: true

        condition: selection
    fields:
        - rule.name
        - dst_ip
        - dst_port
- question: What is the scanning pattern and frequency?
  context: Understanding the scan pattern (sequential, random, targeted) and frequency helps determine if this is automated or manual scanning.

- question: Are there any successful connections following the scan?
  context: |
    Successful connections after scanning could indicate that vulnerabilities were found and potentially exploited.

        - connection.history
- question: What process is associated with this specific network connection?
  context: Correlating process execution to the network connection can give further indication of intent.

- question: Are there any other alerts associated with the scanning system?
  context: Previous malicious activity from the same source may indicate a persistent threat.
