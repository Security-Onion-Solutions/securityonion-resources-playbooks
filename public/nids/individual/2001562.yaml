name: ET ADWARE_PUP Suspected PUP/PUA User-Agent (OSSProxy)
id: 1210460
description: |
  Detects HTTP traffic using the OSSProxy user-agent string, which may indicate potentially unwanted programs (PUP/PUA).
  Could represent legitimate proxy software or data collection tools, though often associated with adware applications.
