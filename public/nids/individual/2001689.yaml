name: ET WORM Potential MySQL bot scanning for SQL server
id: 1247600
description: |
  Detects TCP SYN packets from internal hosts to external MySQL ports (3306), potentially indicating automated scanning or worm behavior.
  May also trigger on legitimate MySQL client connections to external database servers or cloud-hosted MySQL services.
