name: ET SHELLCODE x86 PexFnstenvMov/Sub Encoder
id: 1242501
description: |
  Detects x86 shellcode using the PexFnstenvMov/Sub encoding technique, commonly used to bypass basic signature detection.
  May rarely trigger on legitimate binary data transfers or compressed content containing similar byte patterns.
