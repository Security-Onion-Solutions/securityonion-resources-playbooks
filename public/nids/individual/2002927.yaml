name: ET SNMP Cisco Non-Trap PDU request on SNMPv2 random port
id: 1248442
description: |
  Detects SNMP requests on non-standard ports that may indicate reconnaissance attempts
  or attempts to exploit CVE-2004-0714. May trigger on legitimate SNMP management traffic
  using non-standard port configurations.
