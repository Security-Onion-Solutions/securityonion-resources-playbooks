name: ET MALWARE Backdoor.Hupigon Possible Control Connection Being Established
id: 1253036
description: |
  Detects outbound connections to external hosts on port 8000 with a specific 4-byte null payload pattern.
  This pattern matches Hupigon backdoor control channel establishment but may also occur in legitimate applications using similar protocols.
