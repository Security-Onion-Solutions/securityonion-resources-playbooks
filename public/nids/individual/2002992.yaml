name: ET SCAN Rapid POP3 Connections - Possible Brute Force Attack
id: 1201813
description: |
  Detects rapid POP3 connection attempts from external sources that may indicate brute force attacks.
  May trigger on legitimate mail clients with aggressive connection retry behavior or automated mail processing systems.
