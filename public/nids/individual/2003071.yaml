name: ET ATTACK_RESPONSE Possible /etc/passwd via HTTP (BSD style)
id: 1202541
description: |
  Detects HTTP responses containing BSD-style /etc/passwd file content patterns.
  May indicate successful file disclosure through directory traversal, LFI, or other vulnerabilities.
  Could also trigger on legitimate system administration tools or security scanning.
