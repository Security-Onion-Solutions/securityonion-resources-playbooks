name: ET SCAN Suspicious User-Agent - get-minimal - Possible Vuln Scan
id: 1257115
description: |
  Detects HTTP requests using the "get-minimal" user-agent string, commonly associated with vulnerability scanning tools.
  May also trigger on legitimate applications or custom tools using similar user-agent patterns.
