name: ET MALWARE Socks666 Checkin Success Packet
id: 1253150
description: |
  Detects a specific response packet pattern indicating successful Socks666 malware checkin.
  This signature triggers on a 4-byte response following an established connection where
  the initial checkin pattern was observed. May indicate active C2 communication.
