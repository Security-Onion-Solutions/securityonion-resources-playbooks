name: ET WEB_CLIENT Apple Quicktime RTSP Content-Type overflow attempt
id: 1245899
description: |
  Detects RTSP responses with abnormally long Content-Type headers that may exploit buffer overflow vulnerabilities in Apple QuickTime.
  May trigger on legitimate RTSP streams with unusual header configurations or network issues causing fragmented responses.
