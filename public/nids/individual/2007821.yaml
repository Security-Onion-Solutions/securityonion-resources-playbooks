name: ET USER_AGENTS Suspicious User-Agent (HTTP_CONNECT_)
id: 1228088
description: |
  Detects HTTP requests with user-agents beginning with "HTTP_Connect_". This pattern is associated with certain malware families and remote access tools that use distinctive user-agent strings. May also trigger on legitimate applications or testing tools that use similar naming conventions.
