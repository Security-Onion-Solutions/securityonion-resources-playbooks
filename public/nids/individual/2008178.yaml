name: ET MALWARE Ceckno Keepalive from Controller
id: 1253077
description: |
  Detects single-byte "1" keepalive messages sent from external controllers to internal hosts,
  indicating active C2 communication channels. May trigger on legitimate applications using
  single-character heartbeat protocols.
