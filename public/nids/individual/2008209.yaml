name: ET USER_AGENTS Suspicious User-Agent (SERVER2_03)
id: 1225968
description: |
  Detects HTTP requests using user-agent strings starting with "SERVER", which may indicate
  malware communication or automated tools. Could also trigger on legitimate server software
  or applications that use server-like user-agent strings.
