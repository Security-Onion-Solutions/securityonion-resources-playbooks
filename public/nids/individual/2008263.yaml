name: ET MALWARE DNS Changer HTTP Post Checkin
id: 1252300
description: |
  Detects HTTP POST requests with specific parameter patterns (x= followed by 50 alphanumeric characters) that match DNS Changer malware command and control checkin behavior.
  May trigger on legitimate applications using similar parameter encoding or other malware families with comparable communication patterns.
