name: ET MALWARE Hitpop.AG/Pophot.az HTTP Checkin
id: 1241300
description: |
  Detects HTTP requests to .asp pages with specific parameters (ver, tgid, address) and MAC address format that indicate Hitpop.AG/Pophot.az malware command and control communication.
  Legitimate applications may occasionally use similar parameter names but are unlikely to combine all these specific elements.
