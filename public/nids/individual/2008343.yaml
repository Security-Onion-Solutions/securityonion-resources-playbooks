name: ET USER_AGENTS Suspicious User-Agent (123)
id: 1216378
description: |
  Detects HTTP requests using the minimal user-agent string "123" which is commonly associated with malware, backdoors, and automated tools.
  May occasionally trigger on custom applications or testing tools using simplified user-agent strings.
