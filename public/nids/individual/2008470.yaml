name: ET DNS Excessive NXDOMAIN responses - Possible DNS Backscatter or Domain Generation Algorithm Lookups
id: 1248728
description: |
  Detects excessive NXDOMAIN responses which may indicate DNS backscatter from spoofed queries or domain generation algorithm (DGA) activity.
  May trigger on legitimate batch DNS operations, DNS server maintenance, or applications with dynamic domain queries.
