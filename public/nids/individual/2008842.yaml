name: ET INFO Possible HTTP-TUNNEL to External Proxy for Anonymous Access
id: 1257426
description: |
  Detects HTTP requests to external proxies using specific URI patterns that may indicate
  tunneling software or anonymous proxy access. May trigger on legitimate proxy usage or
  specific web applications using similar URI patterns.
