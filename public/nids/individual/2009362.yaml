name: ET WEB_SERVER /system32/ in Uri - Possible Protected Directory Access Attempt
id: 1202198
description: |
  Detects HTTP requests containing "/system32/" in the URI path, which may indicate directory traversal attempts or reconnaissance of Windows system directories.
  May trigger on legitimate administrative tools, system monitoring software, or applications with similar path structures.
