name: ET HUNTING Suspicious Chmod Usage in URI (Inbound)
id: 1224447
description: |
  Detects HTTP requests containing chmod commands in URI parameters, which may indicate
  web shell activities or exploitation attempts. Can also trigger on legitimate system
  administration tools or file manager applications that use web interfaces.
