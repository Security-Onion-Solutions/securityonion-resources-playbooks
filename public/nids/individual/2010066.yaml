name: ET HUNTING Data POST to an image file (gif)
id: 1248055
description: |
  Detects HTTP POST requests to GIF image files, which may indicate data exfiltration through steganography or covert channels.
  May trigger on legitimate applications that upload images or use tracking pixels with POST methods.
