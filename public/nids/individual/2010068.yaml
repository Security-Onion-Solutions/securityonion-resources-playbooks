name: ET HUNTING Data POST to an image file (jpeg)
id: 1248053
description: |
  Detects HTTP POST requests to URLs ending with .jpeg extensions. This pattern is unusual since image files are typically retrieved via GET requests, not uploaded via POST to existing image paths. May indicate legitimate file upload functionality, web application testing, or attempts to disguise data exfiltration or command and control communication.
