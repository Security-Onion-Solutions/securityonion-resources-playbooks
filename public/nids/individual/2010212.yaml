name: ET ACTIVEX Possible Black Ice Printer Driver Resource Toolkit ActiveX Control ControlJob Function Call Attempt
id: 1247118
description: |
  Detects HTTP responses containing JavaScript code that instantiates the BlackIceDEVMODECtrl.1 ActiveX control and calls the ControlJob function.
  May trigger on legitimate printer management interfaces or security scanning tools testing for ActiveX vulnerabilities.
