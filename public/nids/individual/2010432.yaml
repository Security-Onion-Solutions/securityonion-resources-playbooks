questions:
  - question: What was the complete network payload containing the SPARC shellcode pattern?
    context: Reveals the full context of the shellcode delivery attempt.
    range: +/-15m
    query: "aggregation: false\nlogsource:\n  category: network\n  service: \ndetection:\n  selection:\n    community_id|expand: '%community_id%'\n  condition: selection\nfields:\n  - src_ip\n  - dst_ip\n  - dst_port"
  - question: Does this host normally receive traffic on these high-numbered ports?
