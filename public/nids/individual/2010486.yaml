name: ET DOS Potential Inbound NTP denial-of-service attempt (repeated mode 7 request)
id: 1245697
description: |
  Detects repeated NTP mode 7 requests from external sources, which may indicate attempted NTP amplification attacks or reconnaissance.
  May trigger on legitimate NTP monitoring tools or network troubleshooting activities.
