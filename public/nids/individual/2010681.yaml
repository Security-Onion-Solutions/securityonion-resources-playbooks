  Detects ICMP ping packets containing "Pinging from Delphi code written" string.
  Often indicates network reconnaissance using Delphi-based scanning tools, but may also be legitimate network diagnostics.

  - question: What other ICMP activity occurred from this external host?
    context: Identifies the scope of reconnaissance activity from the same source.
