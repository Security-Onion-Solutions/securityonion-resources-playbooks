name: ET WEB_SERVER Tilde in URI - potential .cgi source disclosure vulnerability
id: 1220935
description: |
  Detects HTTP requests containing tilde characters in URIs targeting CGI scripts, which may indicate attempts to access CGI source code through backup file disclosure vulnerabilities. May trigger on legitimate requests to backup files or automated scanning tools.
