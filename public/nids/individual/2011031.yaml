name: ET SCAN HTTP GET invalid method case
id: 1257110
description: |
  Detects HTTP requests using lowercase "get" method instead of the standard uppercase "GET".
  May indicate scanning tools, fuzzing attempts, or misconfigured applications testing server responses.

questions:
  - question: What was the exact HTTP request with the invalid method case?
    context: Reveals the complete request structure and any additional anomalous headers.

  - question: Does this host normally receive HTTP traffic from external sources?
    context: Determines if external HTTP access to this service is typical for the environment.
