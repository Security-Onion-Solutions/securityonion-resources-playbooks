name: ET ADWARE_PUP User-Agent (gomtour)
id: 1248298
description: |
  Detects HTTP requests using the "gomtour" user-agent string, which is associated with potentially unwanted programs (PUP) or adware.
  This may also trigger on legitimate applications that use this specific user-agent identifier.
