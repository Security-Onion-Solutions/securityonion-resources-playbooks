name: ET SHELLCODE Possible UTF-8 %u90 NOP SLED
id: 1200074
description: |
  Detects HTTP responses containing UTF-8 encoded NOP sled patterns (%u90%u90) commonly used in JavaScript-based shellcode.
  May trigger on legitimate applications that use Unicode encoding or JavaScript minification tools.
