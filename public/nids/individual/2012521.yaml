name: ET MALWARE Generic Win32 Banker Trojan CheckIn
id: 1257058
description: |
  Detects HTTP GET requests to "/sys7." URIs using the Indy Library user-agent, indicating Win32 banking trojan check-in activity.
  May trigger on legitimate applications using the Indy HTTP client library with similar URI patterns.
