name: ET DYN_DNS DYNAMIC_DNS Query to *.dyndns. Domain
id: 1216844
description: |
  Detects DNS queries to DynDNS dynamic DNS domains. These services allow users to map
  hostnames to dynamically changing IP addresses, commonly used for legitimate remote access
  but also leveraged by malware for C2 infrastructure due to their resilience.

  - question: What IP address did the DynDNS domain resolve to?
    context: Determines the actual destination that the dynamic hostname points to.
    range: +/-15m
