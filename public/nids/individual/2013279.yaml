name: ET SHELLCODE Double BackSlash Hex Obfuscated JavaScript Heap Spray 41414141
id: 1200051
description: |
  Detects JavaScript containing hex-encoded 0x41414141 patterns with double backslash obfuscation commonly used in heap spray attacks.
  May trigger on legitimate JavaScript applications using similar encoding patterns or security research tools.
