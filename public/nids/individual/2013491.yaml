name: ET INFO NetBIOS nbtstat Type Query Inbound
id: 1257488
description: |
  Detects inbound NetBIOS nbtstat queries from external networks. These queries request NetBIOS name table information and can be used for network reconnaissance or legitimate network discovery. Common with network scanning tools and Windows network browsing.
