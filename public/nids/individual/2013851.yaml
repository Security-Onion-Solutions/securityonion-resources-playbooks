name: ET INFO Query for Suspicious .us.tf Domain
id: 1213074
description: |
  Detects DNS queries for domains ending in .us.tf, which may be used for dynamic DNS services
  or URL shortening. These domains are often associated with malicious infrastructure but may also
  have legitimate uses for testing or development purposes.
