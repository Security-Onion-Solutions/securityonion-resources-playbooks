name: ET MALWARE UPDATE Protocol Trojan Communication detected on http ports 2
id: 1234221
description: |
  Detects HTTP POST requests to /update endpoints with specific headers (X-Status, X-Size, X-Sn) indicating UPDATE protocol trojan communication.
  May trigger on legitimate software update mechanisms using similar header patterns.
