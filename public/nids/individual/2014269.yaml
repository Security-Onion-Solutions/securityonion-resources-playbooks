id: 1215106
description: |
  Detects HTTP POST requests containing specific bot_id and os_version parameters that match the RShot backdoor communication protocol.
  May indicate compromised host communicating with command and control infrastructure, though could trigger on legitimate applications using similar parameter structures.
