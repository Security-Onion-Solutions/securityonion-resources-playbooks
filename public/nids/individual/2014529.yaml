name: ET MALWARE W32/Taidoor.Backdoor CnC Checkin With Default Substitute MAC Address Field
id: 1239960
description: |
  Detects HTTP requests to PHP endpoints containing the hardcoded MAC address "121212121212" used by Taidoor backdoor malware for command-and-control communication.
  May trigger on legitimate applications using similar URL patterns or testing tools mimicking this malware family.
