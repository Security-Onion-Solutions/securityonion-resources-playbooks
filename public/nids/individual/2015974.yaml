name: ET EXPLOIT_KIT Sibhost Status Check
id: 1245092
description: |
  Detects POST requests to URLs with numeric parameters and Java 1.x user agents, followed by "text=" in the request body.
  This pattern matches Sibhost exploit kit status check communications, but may also occur with legitimate Java applications.
