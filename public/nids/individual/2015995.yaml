name: ET EXPLOIT MySQL Server for Windows Remote SYSTEM Level Exploit (Stuxnet Technique DUMP INTO executable)
id: 1212176
description: |
  Detects SQL queries attempting to dump data into executable files in Windows system directories.
  This technique was used by Stuxnet and other malware to write executables via MySQL's INTO DUMPFILE.
  May trigger on legitimate database backup operations or system administration tasks.
