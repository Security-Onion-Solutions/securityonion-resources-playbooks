name: ET DOS LibuPnP ST UDN Buffer Overflow (CVE-2012-5963)
id: 1245715
description: |
  Detects UDP packets containing UPnP ST headers with excessively long UUID values that may trigger buffer overflow in LibuPnP implementations.
  May trigger on legitimate UPnP devices with unusual UUID formats or network discovery tools.
