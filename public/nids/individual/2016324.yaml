name: ET DOS LibuPnP CVE-2012-5964 ST URN ServiceType Buffer Overflow
id: 1245718
description: |
  Detects UDP packets targeting UPnP services with excessively long URN service strings that may trigger CVE-2012-5964 buffer overflow.
  May trigger on legitimate UPnP device discovery with unusually long service type names or security scanning tools.
