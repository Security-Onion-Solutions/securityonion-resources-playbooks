name: ET DOS LibuPnP CVE-2012-5965 ST URN DeviceType Buffer Overflow
id: 1245719
description: |
  Detects UDP packets with ST headers containing URN device types with excessively long names that could trigger CVE-2012-5965 buffer overflow.
  May trigger on legitimate UPnP discovery traffic with unusually long device type names or malformed UPnP implementations.
