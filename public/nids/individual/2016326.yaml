name: ET DOS LibuPnP CVE-2012-5961 ST UDN Buffer Overflow
id: 1245720
description: |
  Detects UDP packets targeting UPnP services with malformed ST headers that could trigger buffer overflow conditions in LibuPnP implementations.
  May trigger on legitimate UPnP discovery traffic or network scanning tools probing for UPnP services.
