name: ET DOS Miniupnpd SoapAction MethodName Buffer Overflow (CVE-2013-0230)
id: 1245733
description: |
  Detects HTTP POST requests with SOAPAction headers containing excessively long method names that may trigger buffer overflow in miniupnpd.
  May trigger on legitimate UPnP SOAP requests with unusually long method names or network scanning tools testing for this vulnerability.
