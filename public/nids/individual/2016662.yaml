name: ET P2P Possible Bittorrent Activity - Multiple DNS Queries For tracker hosts
id: 1247681
description: |
  Detects multiple DNS queries for "tracker" hosts within a short timeframe, which may indicate BitTorrent activity.
  Could also trigger on legitimate applications using tracker services or network diagnostics.
