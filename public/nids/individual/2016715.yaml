name: ET SHELLCODE Possible Backslash Escaped UTF-16 0c0c Heap Spray
id: 1242545
description: |
  Detects HTTP responses containing backslash escaped UTF-16 0c0c patterns that may indicate heap spray attacks.
  Could trigger on legitimate file transfers or applications that use UTF-16 encoding with specific byte patterns.
