name: ET MALWARE TROJ_NAIKON.A SSL Cert
id: 1252201
description: |
  Detects SSL/TLS connections using certificates with CN=donc and OU=abc associated with NAIKON trojan activity.
  These certificate patterns may indicate C2 communication or could be false positives from legitimate certificates with similar naming.
