name: ET EXPLOIT_KIT Java UA Requesting Numeric.ext From Base Dir (Observed in Redkit/Sakura)
id: 1212241
description: |
  Detects Java user agents requesting files with numeric names and extensions from the root directory.
  This pattern is associated with exploit kit activity, particularly Redkit and Sakura exploit kits.
  May trigger on legitimate Java applications accessing numbered resources or archives.
