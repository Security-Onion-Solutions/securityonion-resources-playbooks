name: ET WORM W32/Njw0rm CnC Beacon
id: 1228516
description: |
  Detects W32/Njw0rm malware communicating with command and control servers using specific beacon patterns.
  May trigger on legitimate applications using similar string patterns, though this is uncommon given the specific nature of the beacon.
