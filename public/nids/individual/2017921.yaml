name: ET DOS Possible NTP DDoS Multiple MON_LIST Seq 0 Response Spanning Multiple Packets IMPL 0x03
id: 1200248
description: |
  Detects multiple NTP MON_LIST responses with sequence 0 that may indicate participation in NTP amplification DDoS attacks.
  May trigger on legitimate NTP monitoring tools or misconfigurations, but pattern suggests amplification abuse.
