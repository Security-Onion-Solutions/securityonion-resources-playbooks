name: ET DOS Likely NTP DDoS In Progress MON_LIST Response to Non-Ephemeral Port IMPL 0x03
id: 1200034
description: |
  Detects NTP MON_LIST responses sent to non-ephemeral ports, indicating potential NTP amplification DDoS attacks.
  May trigger on legitimate NTP monitoring tools or misconfigurations but typically indicates abuse of NTP servers.
