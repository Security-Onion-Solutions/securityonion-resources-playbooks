name: ET HUNTING Suspicious Possible Process Dump in POST body
id: 1229109
description: |
  Detects HTTP POST requests containing "System Idle Process" in the request body, which may indicate system information exfiltration or reconnaissance activity.
  Could also trigger on legitimate system monitoring tools or diagnostic applications that collect process information.
