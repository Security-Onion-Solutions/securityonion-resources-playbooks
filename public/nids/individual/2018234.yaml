name: ET HUNTING JAR Sent Claiming To Be Text Content - Likely Exploit Kit
id: 1203009
description: |
  Detects JAR files being delivered with incorrect MIME type text/* instead of application/java-archive.
  May indicate exploit kit activity attempting to bypass content filters, but could also be legitimate Java applications with misconfigured web servers.
