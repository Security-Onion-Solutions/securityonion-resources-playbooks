name: ET CURRENT_EVENTS Possible Inbound SNMP Router DoS (TTL 1)
id: 1247581
description: |
  Detects SNMP packets with TTL=1 containing specific OID patterns that may indicate DoS attempts against SNMP-enabled devices.
  Could trigger on legitimate network monitoring tools or misconfigured SNMP polling with low TTL values.
