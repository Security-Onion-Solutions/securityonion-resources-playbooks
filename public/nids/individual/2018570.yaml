name: ET MALWARE HTTP Request to a *.su domain with direct request/fakebrowser (multiple families flowbit set)
id: 1233765
description: |
  Detects HTTP requests to .su domains that lack typical browser headers (Referer, Accept-Language).
  May indicate malware C2 communication or automated tools, but could also be legitimate API clients or curl-based applications.
