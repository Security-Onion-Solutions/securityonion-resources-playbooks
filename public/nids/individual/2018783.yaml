name: ET CURRENT_EVENTS Likely Evil XMLDOM Detection of Local File
id: 1249113
description: |
  Detects HTTP responses containing XMLDOM error codes and DOCTYPE patterns that may indicate local file enumeration.
  Could represent legitimate application errors or security scanning, but may also indicate exploitation attempts targeting Internet Explorer XMLDOM vulnerabilities.
