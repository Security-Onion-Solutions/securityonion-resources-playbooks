name: ET MALWARE ABUSE.CH SSL Blacklist Malicious SSL certificate detected (KINS C2)
id: 1253831
description: |
  Detects SSL certificates with known malicious serial numbers and subject names associated with KINS malware C2 infrastructure.
  May trigger on legitimate certificates if they share similar characteristics, though this is unlikely given the specific serial number.
