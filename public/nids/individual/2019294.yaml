name: ET MALWARE Linux/ShellshockCampaign.DDOSBot Reporting IP
id: 1239562
description: |
  Detects outbound traffic containing "My IP:" followed by an IP address pattern, characteristic of Linux/ShellshockCampaign.DDOSBot malware reporting its IP address to command and control infrastructure. May also trigger on legitimate network diagnostic tools or system monitoring applications that report IP addresses.
