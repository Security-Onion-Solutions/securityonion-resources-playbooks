name: ET MALWARE Possible Bedep Connectivity Check
id: 1253580
description: |
  Detects HTTP requests to European Central Bank XML feed with specific 32-character hash parameters that match Bedep malware connectivity patterns.
  May trigger on legitimate financial applications accessing ECB exchange rate data with similar parameter formats.
