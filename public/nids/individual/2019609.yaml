name: ET MALWARE Possible Tinba DGA NXDOMAIN Responses (2)
id: 1214995
description: |
  Detects DNS NXDOMAIN responses matching Tinba banking trojan DGA patterns with 12-character random domains ending in .ru.
  May trigger on legitimate DNS queries to .ru domains or other applications generating similar query patterns.
