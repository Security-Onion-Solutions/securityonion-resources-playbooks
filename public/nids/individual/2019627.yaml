name: ET WEB_SERVER Possible Cookie Based BackDoor Used in Drupal Attacks
id: 1220399
description: |
  Detects HTTP requests containing "preg_replace" in cookie headers, which may indicate backdoor usage in compromised Drupal sites.
  May trigger on legitimate applications that use PHP function names in cookies or debugging scenarios.
