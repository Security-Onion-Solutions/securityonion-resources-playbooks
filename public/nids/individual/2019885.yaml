name: ET MALWARE Possible Dyre DGA NXDOMAIN Responses (.in)
id: 1239575
description: |
  Detects DNS NXDOMAIN responses for domains ending in .in that match Dyre malware domain generation algorithm patterns.
  May trigger on legitimate applications using .in domains or DNS enumeration tools generating similar patterns.
