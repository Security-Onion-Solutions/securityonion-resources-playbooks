name: ET EXPLOIT_KIT Probable malicious download from e-mail link /1.php
id: 1245159
description: |
  Detects HTTP GET requests to "/1.php?r" URIs without referer headers, which may indicate exploitation attempts delivered via email links.
  Could also trigger on legitimate applications using similar URI patterns or privacy tools that strip referer headers.
