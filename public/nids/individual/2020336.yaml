name: ET MALWARE MSIL/Agent.PYO Possible net.tcp CnC Beacon (stat)
id: 1239759
description: |
  Detects TCP connections containing net.tcp protocol patterns with stat endpoints that match MSIL/Agent.PYO malware C2 communications.
  May trigger on legitimate WCF applications using net.tcp bindings or custom TCP protocols with similar patterns.
