name: ET MALWARE Critroni Variant .onion Proxy Domain
id: 1233605
description: |
  Detects DNS queries for domains beginning with "jssestaew3e7ao3q" which are associated with Critroni ransomware variants using Tor proxy domains.
  This pattern is specific to malware infrastructure and unlikely to occur in legitimate traffic.
