name: ET INFO FREAK Weak Export Suite From Client (CVE-2015-0204)
id: 1257457
description: |
  Detects TLS connections where a client advertises support for weak export cipher suites vulnerable to the FREAK attack.
  May trigger on legacy applications, deliberate security testing, or actual FREAK attack attempts.
