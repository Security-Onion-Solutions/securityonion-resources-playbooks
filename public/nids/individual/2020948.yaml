name: ET ADWARE_PUP W32/PicColor Adware CnC Beacon
id: 1208018
description: |
  Detects HTTP GET requests with specific URI patterns (?d= parameter and &format=json) and limited headers that match W32/PicColor adware C2 communication.
  May trigger on legitimate applications using similar API patterns or web services with minimal header sets.
