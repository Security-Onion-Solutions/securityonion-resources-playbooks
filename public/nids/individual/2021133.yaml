name: ET MALWARE JavaScriptBackdoor HTTP POST CnC Beacon
id: 1252120
description: |
  Detects HTTP POST requests containing specific system reconnaissance parameters (username, memory_total, os_caption, os_serialnumber) that match JavaScript backdoor C2 communication patterns.
  May trigger on legitimate system monitoring tools or administrative software that collects similar system information.
