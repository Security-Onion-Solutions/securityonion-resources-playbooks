name: ET MALWARE Possible Duqu 2.0 Accessing SMB/SMB2 Named Pipe (ASCII) 6
id: 1241449
description: |
  Detects SMB traffic containing the specific GUID "{57D2DE92-CE17-4A57-BFD7-CD3C6E965C6A}" associated with Duqu 2.0 malware.
  May trigger on legitimate applications using similar GUIDs or security testing tools.
