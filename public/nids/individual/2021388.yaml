name: ET MALWARE Likely Dridex SSL Cert
id: 1252189
description: |
  Detects SSL certificates with specific subject patterns (OU=portable, CN=nintendo.jp) associated with Dridex malware infrastructure.
  May trigger on legitimate certificates that happen to match these patterns, though this combination is highly suspicious.
