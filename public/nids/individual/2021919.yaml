name: ET MALWARE DustySky CnC Beacon
id: 1238945
description: |
  Detects HTTP requests to PHP endpoints with specific parameter patterns (Pn=, ID=, o=, av=) that match DustySky malware command and control beacons.
  May trigger on legitimate applications using similar parameter structures or automated tools with these patterns.
