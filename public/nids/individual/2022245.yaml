name: ET MALWARE NetBackdoor User-Agent (.net backdoor)
id: 1241476
description: |
  Detects HTTP requests using the distinctive ".net backdor" user-agent string associated with NetBackdoor malware.
  This specific user-agent pattern is rarely seen in legitimate applications and typically indicates C2 communication.
