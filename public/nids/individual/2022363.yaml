name: ET MALWARE Win32/Agent.XST Keepalive
id: 1252477
description: |
  Detects HTTP POST requests to .asp endpoints with specific content-length headers and "ok" request body matching Win32/Agent.XST malware keepalive communications.
  May trigger on legitimate applications using similar HTTP patterns or other malware families with comparable C2 protocols.
