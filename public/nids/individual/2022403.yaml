name: ET MALWARE Win32/7ev3n Ransomware Process Checkin
id: 1238811
description: |
  Detects HTTP GET requests to PHP endpoints with specific parameter patterns (SSTART, CRYPTED_DATA, ID) and "Internet Explorer" user-agent, characteristic of Win32/7ev3n ransomware command and control communications. May trigger on legitimate applications using similar parameter structures or older browser versions.
