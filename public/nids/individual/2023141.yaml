name: ET EXPLOIT RST Flood With Window
id: 1242713
description: |
  Detects a flood of TCP RST packets with non-zero window values, indicating potential TCP sequence number inference attacks.
  May trigger during network congestion, faulty network equipment, or legitimate connection resets with unusual timing patterns.
