name: ET MALWARE ABUSE.CH SSL Fingerprint Blacklist Malicious SSL Certificate Detected (Gootkit C2)
id: 1253628
description: |
  Detects SSL certificates matching known Gootkit banking trojan C2 infrastructure based on specific certificate serial numbers and subject patterns.
  May trigger on legitimate certificates that coincidentally match these patterns, though this is extremely rare for the specific combination detected.
