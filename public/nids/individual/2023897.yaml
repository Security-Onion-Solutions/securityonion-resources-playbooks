name: ET EXPLOIT Possible Ticketbleed Server Hello (CVE-2016-9244)
id: 1244496
description: |
  Detects TLS server responses that may indicate Ticketbleed vulnerability exploitation (CVE-2016-9244).
  This vulnerability allows extraction of up to 31 bytes of server memory through malformed session tickets.
  May trigger on legitimate TLS implementations with specific handshake patterns.
