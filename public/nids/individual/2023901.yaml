name: ET TELNET busybox MEMES Hackers - Possible Brute Force Attack
id: 1217823
description: |
  Detects Telnet connections containing "MEMES" string after busybox authentication, potentially indicating Mirai botnet brute force activity.
  May trigger on legitimate Telnet sessions or security testing that uses similar strings.
