name: ET MALWARE MagikPOS CnC Beacon
id: 1200918
description: |
  Detects MagikPOS malware command and control beacons characterized by POST requests to /api/?act=in with base64-encoded payloads and minimal HTTP headers.
  May trigger on legitimate applications using similar API endpoints with base64 data transmission.
