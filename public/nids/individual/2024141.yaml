name: ET EXPLOIT_KIT Suspicious Decimal IP Redirect - Observed in RIG EK Redirects M9
id: 1245185
description: |
  Detects HTTP 302 redirects using decimal IP addresses instead of domain names, commonly used by exploit kits like RIG EK to evade detection.
  May trigger on legitimate applications using IP-based redirects or content delivery systems with numeric addressing.
