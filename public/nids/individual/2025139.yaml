name: ET INFO localtunnel Reverse Proxy Domain (localtunnel .me in TLS SNI)
id: 1205701
description: |
  Detects TLS connections to localtunnel.me domains, indicating use of reverse proxy tunneling services.
  May represent legitimate remote access or development activities, but can also facilitate data exfiltration or remote access bypassing network controls.
