name: ET HUNTING Observed Let's Encrypt Certificate for Suspicious TLD (.xyz)
id: 1210734
description: |
  Detects TLS certificates issued by Let's Encrypt for .xyz domains, which are often used in malicious campaigns due to their low cost.
  May trigger on legitimate services using .xyz domains or development/testing environments.
