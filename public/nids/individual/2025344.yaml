id: 1239010
description: |
  Detects HTTP GET requests to PHP endpoints with specific parameters (action, hwid, access) that match W32/SPARS/ARS Stealer command and control communication patterns.
  May trigger on legitimate applications using similar parameter structures or web applications with comparable URL patterns.
