name: ET MALWARE Known Malicious Redirector in DNS Lookup (vip.rm028.cn)
id: 1203918
description: |
  Detects DNS queries to vip.rm028.cn, a domain associated with Chinese criminal groups conducting drive-by download campaigns.
  May trigger on legitimate DNS queries if the domain is later repurposed for benign purposes.
