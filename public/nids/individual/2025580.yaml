name: ET MALWARE Win32/Rarog Stealer CnC Keep-Alive
id: 1215118
description: |
  Detects HTTP POST requests to /check.php with UUID-formatted data that match Win32/Rarog stealer keep-alive communication patterns.
  May trigger on legitimate applications using similar REST API patterns with UUID identifiers.
