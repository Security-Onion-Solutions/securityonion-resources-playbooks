name: ET ATTACK_RESPONSE Inbound PowerShell Checking for Virtual Host (Win32_Fan WMI)
id: 1202554
description: |
  Detects inbound HTTP responses containing PowerShell commands that query Win32_Fan WMI objects.
  This technique is used by threat actors to detect virtual environments before deploying payloads.
  May also trigger on legitimate system administration scripts or security tools.
