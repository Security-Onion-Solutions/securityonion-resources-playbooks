name: ET MALWARE Observed Malicious SSL Cert (ServHelper CnC)
id: 1214323
description: |
  Detects SSL certificates with specific issuer and serial number patterns associated with ServHelper malware command and control infrastructure.
  May trigger on legitimate certificates that coincidentally match these patterns, though this is extremely unlikely.
