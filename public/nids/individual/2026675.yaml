name: ET MALWARE Inbound PowerShell Saving Base64 Decoded Payload to Temp M1 2018-11-29
id: 1241578
description: |
  Detects PowerShell scripts that decode base64 content and save files to Windows temp directory.
  This pattern is commonly used by malware families like MuddyWater but may also trigger on legitimate
  system administration scripts or software installers that use PowerShell for file operations.
