name: ET ATTACK_RESPONSE UTF8 base64 string /This Program/ in DNS TXT Response
id: 1202612
description: |
  Detects DNS TXT responses containing base64 encoded strings matching "This Program" pattern.
  May indicate DNS-based command and control communication or data exfiltration. Could trigger on legitimate base64 content in DNS records.
