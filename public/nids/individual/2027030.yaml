name: ET ATTACK_RESPONSE UTF16-LE base64 string /This Program/ in DNS TXT Response
id: 1204696
description: |
  Detects DNS TXT responses containing UTF-16LE base64 encoded strings matching "/This Program/" pattern.
  May indicate DNSlivery toolkit usage for data exfiltration or command delivery through DNS channels.
  Could also trigger on legitimate applications using DNS TXT records for software identification.
