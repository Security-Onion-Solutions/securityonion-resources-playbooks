name: ET MALWARE ELF/Mirai Variant UA Outbound (Tsunami)
id: 1233591
description: |
  Detects outbound HTTP connections using the "Tsunami" user-agent string, which is associated with ELF/Mirai malware variants.
  This user-agent pattern is commonly used by IoT botnets and DDoS malware. May occasionally trigger on legitimate software or security tools using similar naming.
