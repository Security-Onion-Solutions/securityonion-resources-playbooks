name: ET INFO DNS Query to a Reverse Proxy Service Observed
id: 1205309
description: |
  Detects DNS queries to PageKite reverse proxy service domains.
  PageKite is a legitimate service that allows users to expose local services through reverse proxies.
  May indicate legitimate remote access needs or unauthorized tunneling of internal services.
