name: ET MALWARE Patchwork APT CnC Beacon 2
id: 1238958
description: |
  Detects HTTP GET requests to PHP scripts with specific URI patterns and missing headers consistent with Patchwork APT command and control beacons.
  May trigger on legitimate applications using similar PHP parameter patterns or automated tools with minimal headers.
