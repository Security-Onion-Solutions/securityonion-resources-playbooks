name: ET MALWARE Possible APT40/Dadstache Stage 2 Payload Beacon
id: 1241725
description: |
  Detects HTTP POST requests with specific form-data patterns containing disguised PNG files with JPEG content-type headers, potentially indicating APT40/Dadstache C2 communication.
  May trigger on legitimate file upload applications or security testing tools using similar multipart form patterns.
