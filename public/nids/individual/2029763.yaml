name: ET SCAN ELF/Mirai Variant User-Agent (Inbound)
id: 1200153
description: |
  Detects inbound HTTP connections using the "iamdelta" user-agent string associated with ELF/Mirai malware variants.
  This user-agent is characteristic of IoT botnet activity but could appear in security research or testing tools.
