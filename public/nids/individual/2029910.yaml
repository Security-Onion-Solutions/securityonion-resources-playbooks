name: ET MALWARE Suspected SPECULOOS Backdoor CnC Init Packet Masquerading as SNI Request to live .com
id: 1256163
description: |
  Detects TLS handshake patterns matching SPECULOOS backdoor C2 initialization packets that masquerade as legitimate SNI requests to login.live.com.
  May trigger on legitimate SSL clients with similar cipher suites or custom TLS implementations.
