name: ET WEB_SERVER WSO 2.6 Webshell Accessed on Internal Compromised Server
id: 1220605
description: |
  Detects access to WSO 2.6 webshell interface on internal servers. WSO is a PHP webshell commonly used for persistent access after initial compromise.
  May rarely trigger on legitimate system administration tools with similar interface patterns.
