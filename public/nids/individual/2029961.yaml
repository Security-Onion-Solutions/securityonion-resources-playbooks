name: ET HUNTING Observed DNS Query for OpenNIC Alternative DNS TLD (.neo)
id: 1228646
description: |
  Detects DNS queries for domains using the .neo top-level domain from OpenNIC alternative DNS infrastructure.
  May represent legitimate use of alternative DNS namespaces or potential DNS tunneling and evasion techniques.
