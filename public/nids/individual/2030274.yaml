name: ET MALWARE ELF/Mirai Variant User-Agent (Outbound)
id: 1241893
description: |
  Detects outbound HTTP requests using the "Sa0aS" user-agent string associated with ELF/Mirai malware variants.
  This specific user-agent pattern is characteristic of IoT botnets performing reconnaissance or C2 communications.
