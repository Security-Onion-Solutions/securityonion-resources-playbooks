name: ET MALWARE Possible DNS Tunneling Observed
id: 1203848
description: |
  Detects DNS queries with long encoded strings followed by .aaaaaaaaaaaa domain, indicating possible DNS tunneling for data exfiltration.
  May trigger on legitimate applications using similar domain patterns or base32/base36 encoding schemes.
