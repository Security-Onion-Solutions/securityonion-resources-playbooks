name: ET HUNTING Possible Malicious Document Request to NOIP DynDNS Domain
id: 1203025
description: |
  Detects Microsoft Office applications making HTTP requests to NoIP dynamic DNS domains.
  May indicate malicious documents attempting to retrieve payloads or establish C2 communications,
  but could also represent legitimate Office add-ins or document templates hosted on dynamic DNS.
