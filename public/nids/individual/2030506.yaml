name: ET HUNTING Possible Malicious Document Request to NOIP DynDNS Domain
id: 1226082
description: |
  Detects HTTP requests with Microsoft Office User-Agent to NoIP dynamic DNS domains.
  May indicate document-based malware communicating with command and control infrastructure,
  but could also represent legitimate Office applications accessing dynamic DNS services.
