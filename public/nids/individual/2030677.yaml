name: ET MALWARE ELF/Mirai Variant User-Agent (Outbound)
id: 1241898
description: |
  Detects outbound HTTP connections using the "m3th/" user-agent string characteristic of ELF/Mirai botnet variants.
  This user-agent is associated with IoT botnet communications and is rarely seen in legitimate traffic.
