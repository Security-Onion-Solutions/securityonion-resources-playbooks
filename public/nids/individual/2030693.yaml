name: ET MALWARE ELF/Mirai Variant User-Agent (Outbound)
id: 1241899
description: |
  Detects outbound HTTP connections using the "ZASE" user-agent string associated with ELF/Mirai malware variants.
  This user-agent is primarily seen in IoT botnet traffic and is rarely used by legitimate applications.
