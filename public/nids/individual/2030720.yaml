name: ET MALWARE Observed Malicious SSL Cert (Sidewinder CnC)
id: 1214589
description: |
  Detects SSL/TLS connections using certificates with CN=cdn-gov.net issued by Let's Encrypt.
  This certificate pattern has been associated with Sidewinder APT group command and control infrastructure.
  May trigger on legitimate services using similar certificate naming patterns.
