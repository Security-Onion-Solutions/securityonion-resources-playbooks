name: ET INFO Observed ZeroSSL Certificate for Suspicious TLD (.pw)
id: 1205544
description: |
  Detects TLS certificates issued by ZeroSSL for .pw domains. While .pw is a legitimate Palau TLD,
  it has been observed in malicious campaigns due to low cost and minimal verification requirements.
  May trigger on legitimate services using .pw domains with ZeroSSL certificates.
