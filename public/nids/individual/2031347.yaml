name: ET MALWARE Backdoor.SUNBURST HTTP Request to digitalcollege.org
id: 1240872
description: |
  Detects HTTP requests to digitalcollege.org infrastructure associated with SUNBURST backdoor activity.
  This domain was identified as part of the SolarWinds supply chain compromise campaign.
  May trigger on legitimate access if the domain is later repurposed for benign purposes.
