name: ET MALWARE [Fireeye] Observed Backdoor.SUNBURST CnC Domain (incomeupdate.com in TLS SNI)
id: 1201170
description: |
  Detects TLS connections to domains ending with incomeupdate.com, identified as SUNBURST backdoor command and control infrastructure.
  Legitimate connections to this domain are extremely unlikely given its association with targeted supply chain attacks.
