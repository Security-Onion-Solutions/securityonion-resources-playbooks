name: ET MALWARE Dark Halo/SUNBURST CnC Domain (solartrackingsystem.net in TLS SNI)
id: 1240896
description: |
  Detects TLS connections to domains containing "solartrackingsystem.net" which is associated with Dark Halo/SUNBURST malware command and control infrastructure.
  May trigger on legitimate connections if organizations use similar domain names for solar tracking systems.
