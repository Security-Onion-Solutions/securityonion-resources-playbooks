name: ET EXPLOIT Possible NSDP (Netgear) Unauthenticated Write Access to DHCP Config (CVE-2020-35226)
id: 1203842
description: |
  Detects UDP traffic to port 60000 containing NSDP protocol patterns that may indicate
  attempts to exploit CVE-2020-35226 for unauthenticated DHCP configuration changes.
  May trigger on legitimate network discovery or management software.
