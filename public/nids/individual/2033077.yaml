description: |
  Detects STUN (Session Traversal Utilities for NAT) binding requests sent to non-standard low ports.
  STUN is commonly used by VoIP applications, video conferencing, and P2P software for NAT traversal.
  May indicate legitimate applications or potential covert communication channels.
