name: ET MALWARE Linux DarkRadiation Ransomware Activity Attack Check
id: 1232297
description: |
  Detects HTTP requests to "/check_attack/0.txt" with Wget user-agent and numeric IP hosts, matching DarkRadiation ransomware communication patterns.
  May also trigger on legitimate automated scripts or vulnerability scanners using Wget to access IP-based endpoints.
