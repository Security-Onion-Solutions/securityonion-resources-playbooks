name: ET EXPLOIT Unknown Command Injection Attempt Inbound (Possible Mirai Activity)
id: 1211890
description: |
  Detects POST requests to URIs starting with "/op_type=" containing semicolon characters, indicating potential command injection attempts.
  May trigger on legitimate applications using operation type parameters or administrative interfaces with command-like syntax.
