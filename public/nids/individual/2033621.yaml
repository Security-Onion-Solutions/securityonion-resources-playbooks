name: ET INFO Observed SSL Cert (DNS Service)
id: 1205182
description: |
  Detects SSL certificates containing .sslip.io domains, which provide DNS services
  that resolve to IP addresses embedded in the hostname. May indicate legitimate
  development/testing or potential DNS tunneling and evasion techniques.
