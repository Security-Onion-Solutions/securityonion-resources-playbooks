name: ET MALWARE SNIcat - Detected C2 Commands (CD)
id: 1235479
description: |
  Detects SNIcat malware C2 communications using specific SNI patterns starting with "CD-" followed by 16 alphanumeric characters.
  This indicates active command and control traffic from compromised systems to attacker infrastructure.
