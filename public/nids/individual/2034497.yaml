name: ET HUNTING Possible UPnP UUID Overflow Exploit Attempt from External Host
id: 1226492
description: |
  Detects HTTP NOTIFY requests with unusually long UUID headers that may indicate UPnP buffer overflow exploitation attempts.
  May trigger on legitimate UPnP devices with verbose UUID strings or network discovery tools.
