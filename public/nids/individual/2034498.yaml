name: ET HUNTING Possible UPnP UUID Overflow Exploit Attempt from Internal Host
id: 1226493
description: |
  Detects HTTP NOTIFY requests with potentially oversized UPnP UUID values that may indicate buffer overflow attempts.
  May trigger on legitimate UPnP devices with long UUID strings or network discovery tools.
