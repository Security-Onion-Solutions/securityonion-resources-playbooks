name: ET EXPLOIT Apache Obfuscated log4j RCE Attempt (tcp ldap) (CVE-2021-44228)
id: 1211500
description: |
  Detects obfuscated JNDI LDAP strings in TCP traffic that match Log4j exploitation patterns using environment variable substitution.
  May trigger on legitimate Java applications using complex JNDI lookups or security testing tools.
