name: ET HUNTING Possible Apache log4j RCE Attempt - Any Protocol (lower TCP Bypass) (Outbound) (CVE-2021-44228)
id: 1229306
description: |
  Detects outbound connections containing JNDI strings with "lower" obfuscation patterns that may indicate Log4j RCE attempts.
  May trigger on legitimate applications using JNDI lookups or security testing tools.
