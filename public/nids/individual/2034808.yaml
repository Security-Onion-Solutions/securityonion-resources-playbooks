name: ET HUNTING Possible Apache log4j RCE Attempt - Any Protocol (lower TCP Bypass) (CVE-2021-44228)
id: 1203375
description: |
  Detects TCP traffic containing the pattern "${lower:j" followed by "ndi" which may indicate Log4j RCE exploitation attempts using case obfuscation.
  May trigger on legitimate applications using JNDI lookups or security testing tools.
