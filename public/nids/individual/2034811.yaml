name: ET HUNTING Possible Apache log4j RCE Attempt - Any Protocol (upper UDP Bypass) (CVE-2021-44228)
id: 1210125
description: |
  Detects UDP traffic containing obfuscated JNDI strings using the "upper" function to bypass detection.
  May trigger on legitimate applications using JNDI lookups or network protocols with similar byte patterns.
