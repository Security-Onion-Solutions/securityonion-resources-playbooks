id: 1202708
description: |
  Detects HTTP GET requests containing specific parameters (host, port, request) with encoded command shell patterns that match ELEFANTE/ElephantBeetle command tunneling infrastructure.
  May trigger on legitimate applications using similar parameter structures or security testing tools.
