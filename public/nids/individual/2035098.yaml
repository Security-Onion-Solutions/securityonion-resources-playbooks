name: ET MALWARE Win32/Trojan.Agent.FSTT CnC Activity
id: 1252236
description: |
  Detects HTTP GET requests to .php URLs with specific parameters (company_id, lua) and user-agent starting with "Installed".
  Associated with Win32/Trojan.Agent.FSTT command and control communications, though may trigger on legitimate applications using similar patterns.
