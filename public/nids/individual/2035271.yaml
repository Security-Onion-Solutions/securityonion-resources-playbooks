id: 1218102
description: |
  Detects POST requests to /postUP.php with specific user-agent and header patterns characteristic of JS/TrojanDownloader.Agent.TXV malware family.
  May trigger on legitimate applications using similar HTTP patterns, though the specific combination is highly indicative of malware activity.
