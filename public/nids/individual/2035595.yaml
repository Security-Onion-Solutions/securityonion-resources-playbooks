name: ET MALWARE Generic AsyncRAT/zgRAT Style SSL Cert
id: 1235653
description: |
  Detects SSL certificates with characteristics commonly used by AsyncRAT and zgRAT malware families.
  These certificates typically have matching subject and issuer CN fields without organizational details.
  May trigger on legitimate self-signed certificates with similar patterns.
