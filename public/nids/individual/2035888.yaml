name: ET EXPLOIT Possible OpenSSL Infinite Loop Inducing Cert Inbound via UDP (CVE-2022-0778)
id: 1211591
description: |
  Detects UDP packets containing specific certificate patterns that could trigger CVE-2022-0778 OpenSSL infinite loop vulnerability.
  May trigger on legitimate certificate exchanges or SSL/TLS handshakes over UDP protocols like DTLS.
