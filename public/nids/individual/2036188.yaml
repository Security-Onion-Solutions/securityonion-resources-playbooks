name: ET DYN_DNS DYNAMIC_DNS Query to a *.onmypc.net Domain
id: 1210738
description: |
  Detects DNS queries to onmypc.net dynamic DNS domains. This service allows users to create
  dynamic DNS hostnames that update automatically. May indicate legitimate remote access setup
  or command and control communications using dynamic DNS infrastructure.
