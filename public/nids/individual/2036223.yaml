name: ET HUNTING Potential Forced OGNL Evaluation - HTTP Header
id: 1248418
description: |
  Detects HTTP headers containing percent-encoded curly braces (%7b %7d) that may indicate
  attempts to trigger OGNL evaluation in web applications. May also trigger on legitimate
  applications or testing tools that use URL-encoded special characters in headers.
