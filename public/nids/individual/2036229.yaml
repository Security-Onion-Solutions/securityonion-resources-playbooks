name: ET INFO [TW] IPFS Protocol HTTP Headers Observed
id: 1220140
description: |
  Detects HTTP responses containing IPFS protocol headers (x-ipfs-*). IPFS is a distributed file system
  that can be used for legitimate content distribution but may also facilitate malware distribution or data exfiltration.
