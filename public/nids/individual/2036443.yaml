name: ET WEB_SERVER Possible SSRF Attempt Inbound Using Common Dork M16
id: 1245958
description: |
  Detects HTTP requests with callback parameters containing URLs or IP addresses that may indicate
  Server-Side Request Forgery (SSRF) attempts. May trigger on legitimate applications using callbacks
  for webhooks, APIs, or redirect functionality.
