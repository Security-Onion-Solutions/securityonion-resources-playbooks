name: ET MALWARE PoshC2 - Observed Default URI Structure M1
id: 1256112
description: |
  Detects HTTP requests to PoshC2 C2 framework default URI patterns. The specific URI structure "/utag/lbg/main/prod/utag.15.js/" with parameters is characteristic of PoshC2 implant communications.
  May trigger on legitimate applications using similar URI patterns or security research tools.
