name: ET MALWARE Suspected BPFDoor ICMP Magic Packet (Inbound)
id: 1254202
description: |
  Detects ICMP packets containing specific magic bytes (0x7255) that match BPFDoor malware communication patterns.
  This backdoor uses ICMP packets to establish covert communication channels and may indicate advanced persistent threat activity.
