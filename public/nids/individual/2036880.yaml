id: 1209022
description: |
  Detects WebDAV requests to Windows Startup directory paths using Microsoft-WebDAV-MiniRedir user agent.
  May indicate legitimate file synchronization or automated system administration, but could also represent
  attempts to place files in the Windows Startup folder for persistence.
