name: ET INFO Out-of-Band Interaction Domain in DNS Lookup (oast .online)
id: 1220023
description: |
  Detects DNS queries to Out-of-Band Application Security Testing (OAST) domains ending in .oast.site.
  These domains are commonly used by security tools like Interactsh for vulnerability testing and may indicate legitimate security scanning or exploitation attempts.
