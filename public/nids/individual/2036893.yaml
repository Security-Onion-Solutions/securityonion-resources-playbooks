name: ET INFO Out-of-Band Interaction Domain in DNS Lookup (oast .fun)
id: 1206046
description: |
  Detects DNS queries to Interactsh OAST (Out-of-Band Application Security Testing) domains ending in .oast.fun.
  These domains are commonly used by security testing tools and vulnerability scanners for blind vulnerability detection.
  May indicate legitimate security testing or actual exploitation attempts using OAST techniques.
