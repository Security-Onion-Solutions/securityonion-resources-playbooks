name: ET MALWARE Loxes/Mongall Related CnC Beacon M4 (GET)
id: 1218932
description: |
  Detects HTTP GET requests with base64-encoded URIs and specific user-agent patterns associated with Loxes/Mongall malware C2 communications.
  This pattern is linked to the AoqinDragon APT group. May rarely trigger on legitimate applications using similar encoded URIs.
