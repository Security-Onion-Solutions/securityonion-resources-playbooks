name: ET MALWARE Lazarus APT Related VSingle Backdoor Activity (GET)
id: 1239342
description: |
  Detects HTTP GET requests with specific parameter patterns (uid with 8 digits, upw with base64-like data) and Linux user-agent that match VSingle backdoor communications.
  May trigger on legitimate applications using similar parameter structures or Linux-based automated tools.
