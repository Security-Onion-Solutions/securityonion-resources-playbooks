name: ET MALWARE ENV Variable Data Exfiltration Attempt (HTTP POST)
id: 1250320
description: |
  Detects HTTP POST requests with specific URI patterns and JSON content type that may indicate environment variable data exfiltration.
  May trigger on legitimate development tools, CI/CD systems, or repository management applications using similar API patterns.
