name: ET HUNTING HTTP GET Request XOR Key 37
id: 1223869
description: |
  Detects HTTP GET requests containing XOR-encoded content with key 37, which may indicate obfuscated malware communications or data exfiltration attempts.
  Could also trigger on legitimate applications using XOR encoding for data protection or custom protocols.
