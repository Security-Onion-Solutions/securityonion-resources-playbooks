name: ET HUNTING HTTP GET Request XOR Key 7d
id: 1223929
description: |
  Detects HTTP GET requests containing XOR-encoded content with key 0x7d, which may indicate obfuscated malware communications or data exfiltration attempts.
  May also trigger on legitimate applications using XOR encoding for data protection or compression.
