name: ET HUNTING HTTP POST Request XOR Key 06
id: 1207670
description: |
  Detects HTTP POST requests containing XOR-encoded content with key 06, which may indicate
  obfuscated communication channels. Could represent legitimate encrypted data transmission
  or security testing tools performing obfuscation analysis.
