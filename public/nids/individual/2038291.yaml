name: ET HUNTING HTTP POST Request XOR Key 49
id: 1223726
description: |
  Detects HTTP POST requests containing XOR-encoded data with key 49, which may indicate
  obfuscated communication or data exfiltration. Could also trigger on legitimate applications
  using XOR encoding for data protection or compression.
