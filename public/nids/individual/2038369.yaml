name: ET HUNTING HTTP POST Request XOR Key 97
id: 1223739
description: |
  Detects HTTP POST requests containing XOR-encoded data using key 97, which may indicate
  data obfuscation or encoding techniques. This could represent legitimate application data
  encoding or attempts to evade detection systems.
