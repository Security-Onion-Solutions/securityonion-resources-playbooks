name: ET MALWARE Win32/Matanbuchus Loader Activity (POST)
id: 1239355
description: |
  Detects HTTP POST requests to PHP endpoints with specific base64-encoded payloads and missing Mozilla user-agent strings, consistent with Matanbuchus loader C2 communication patterns.
  May trigger on legitimate applications using similar request structures or custom HTTP clients.
