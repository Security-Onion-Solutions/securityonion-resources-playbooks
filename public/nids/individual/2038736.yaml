name: ET EXPLOIT NetGear WNR2000v5 Buffer Overflow Attempt Inbound (CVE-2017-6862)
id: 1208305
description: |
  Detects GET requests to unauth.cgi with unusually large URIs containing timestamp parameters targeting NetGear WNR2000v5 routers.
  May trigger on legitimate router administration or automated scanning tools.
