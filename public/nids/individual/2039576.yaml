name: ET INFO Observed DNS Query to KnowBe4 Simulated Phish Domain (malwarebouncer .com)
id: 1220085
description: |
  Detects DNS queries to malwarebouncer.com, which is used by KnowBe4 for phishing simulation training.
  This is expected behavior during security awareness training exercises but may indicate actual phishing attempts if not part of a scheduled training campaign.
