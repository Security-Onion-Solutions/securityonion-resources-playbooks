name: ET RETIRED GO/Titan Stealer Data Exfiltration Attempt
id: 1216942
description: |
  Detects HTTP POST requests to "/sendlog" endpoint with base64-encoded data patterns consistent with Titan Stealer malware.
  May trigger on legitimate applications using similar base64 encoding or sendlog endpoints for logging purposes.
