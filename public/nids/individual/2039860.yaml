name: ET DYN_DNS DYNAMIC_DNS Query to a *.ohbah.com Domain
id: 1226907
description: |
  Detects DNS queries to ohbah.com dynamic DNS domains. These may be legitimate
  dynamic DNS usage for home services or remote access, but are also commonly
  used for C2 communications due to their free registration and dynamic IP mapping.
