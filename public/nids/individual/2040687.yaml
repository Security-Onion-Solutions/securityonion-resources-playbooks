name: ET DYN_DNS DYNAMIC_DNS Query to a *.reg.my.id Domain
id: 1229701
description: |
  Detects DNS queries to .reg.my.id dynamic DNS domains. These domains can be used for legitimate dynamic DNS services but are also commonly used for command and control communications due to their free registration and frequent IP changes.
