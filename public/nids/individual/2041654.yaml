name: ET MALWARE Win32/DuckLogs Malware Activity (GET)
id: 1233122
description: |
  Detects HTTP GET requests to /api.php with specific parameter patterns and header structure characteristic of Win32/DuckLogs malware C2 communications.
  May trigger on legitimate applications using similar API patterns, though the specific combination of parameters and headers is highly indicative of this malware family.
