name: ET DYN_DNS DYNAMIC_DNS Query to a *.16-b .it Domain
id: 1224927
description: |
  Detects DNS queries to *.16-b.it domains, a dynamic DNS service that may be used for legitimate hosting or command and control infrastructure.
  May indicate C2 communications, but could also be legitimate use of dynamic DNS services.
