name: ET DYN_DNS DYNAMIC_DNS Query to a *.myddns.biz Domain
id: 1224945
description: |
  Detects DNS queries to myddns.biz dynamic DNS domains, which may indicate command and control activity or legitimate dynamic DNS usage.
  Can trigger on both malicious C2 infrastructure and legitimate services using dynamic DNS for remote access.
