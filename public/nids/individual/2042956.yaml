name: ET EXPLOIT Observed Mirai/Gafgyt Post Brute Force Activity (GET)
id: 1212588
description: |
  Detects repeated HTTP GET requests to specific URI patterns with wget user-agent targeting IP addresses directly.
  May indicate Mirai/Gafgyt botnet activity following successful brute force attacks, but could also trigger on legitimate wget usage or security scanning.
