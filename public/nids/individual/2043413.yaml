name: ET MALWARE Pyramid Framework Payload Request (base-pythonmemorymodule.py)
id: 1233727
description: |
  Detects HTTP requests for the Pyramid Framework's base-pythonmemorymodule.py payload with specific Python-urllib user agent and authorization headers.
  May trigger on legitimate Python applications downloading memory modules or automated systems with similar patterns.
