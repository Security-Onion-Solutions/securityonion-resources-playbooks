name: ET MOBILE_MALWARE Android/Gigabud CnC Check-in M12
id: 1224050
description: |
  Detects HTTP POST requests to URIs containing "/x/user-bank-pwd?bank_id=" with "okhttp/" user-agent.
  This pattern matches Android/Gigabud RAT check-in behavior but may also trigger on legitimate banking applications using OkHttp library.
