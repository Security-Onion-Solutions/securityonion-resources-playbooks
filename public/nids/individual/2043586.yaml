name: ET INFO Observed DNS over HTTPS Domain in TLS SNI (gustamadh .dynv6 .net)
id: 1205291
description: |
  Detects TLS connections to the dynamic DNS domain gustamadh.dynv6.net, which may indicate DNS over HTTPS usage or command and control tunneling.
  Could represent legitimate privacy-focused DNS resolution or malicious C2 communications using protocol tunneling.
