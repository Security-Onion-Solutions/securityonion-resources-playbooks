name: ET MALWARE Observed Glupteba CnC Domain (nisdably .com in TLS SNI)
id: 1235957
description: |
  Detects TLS connections to domains ending in .nisdably.com associated with Glupteba botnet C2 infrastructure.
  Legitimate connections to these domains are extremely unlikely as they are dedicated malware infrastructure.
