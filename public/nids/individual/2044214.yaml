name: ET MALWARE Likely APT29 Retrieving Payload Embedded In PNG 3
id: 1252318
description: |
  Detects GET requests for PNG files with minimal HTTP headers, characteristic of APT29 steganographic payload retrieval.
  May trigger on legitimate applications with unusual HTTP client implementations or automated tools fetching PNG images.
