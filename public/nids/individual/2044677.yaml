name: ET MALWARE Fortigate TABLEFLIP Backdoor Trigger - Magic Number Sequence
id: 1236045
description: |
  Detects TCP traffic containing a specific magic number sequence associated with the TABLEFLIP backdoor targeting Fortigate devices.
  May trigger on legitimate network protocols using similar byte patterns or encrypted traffic with coincidental matching sequences.
