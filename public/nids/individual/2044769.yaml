name: ET MALWARE Suspected Muggle Stealer Activity M2
id: 1215142
description: |
  Detects HTTP POST requests to IP addresses with specific URI patterns and "DiskInfoPost" content characteristic of Muggle Stealer malware.
  May trigger on legitimate applications that POST disk information to IP-based endpoints or security tools testing stealer signatures.
