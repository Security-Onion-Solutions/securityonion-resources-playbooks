name: ET EXPLOIT_KIT TDS checkResult Request - Observed Leading to CryptoClipper
id: 1212231
description: |
  Detects HTTP POST requests to PHP endpoints with specific headers (x-rid, x-ohost) used by Traffic Direction Systems (TDS) that lead to cryptocurrency clipper malware deployment. May trigger on legitimate applications using similar header patterns.
