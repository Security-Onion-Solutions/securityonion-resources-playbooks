name: ET MALWARE Win32/TrojanDropper.Agent.SSQ Variant Checkin
id: 1214689
description: |
  Detects HTTP GET requests to specific URI patterns with Indy Library user-agent used by Win32/TrojanDropper.Agent.SSQ malware for command and control communication.
  May trigger on legitimate applications using Indy HTTP components, though the specific URI pattern is highly suspicious.
