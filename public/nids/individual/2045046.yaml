name: ET HUNTING Gamaredon APT Style jpeg Request (GET)
id: 1215981
description: |
  Detects HTTP GET requests matching Gamaredon APT group communication patterns, specifically requests for JPEG files with structured URI paths to IP addresses.
  May trigger on legitimate image requests to IP-based servers or automated systems accessing images through structured paths.
