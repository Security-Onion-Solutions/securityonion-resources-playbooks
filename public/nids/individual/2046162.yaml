name: ET SCADA IEC-104 STOPDT (Stop Data Transfer) Activation
id: 1216748
description: |
  Detects IEC-104 STOPDT (Stop Data Transfer) activation commands on SCADA networks.
  This is a legitimate protocol command used to stop data transmission in industrial control systems, but may indicate operational changes or potential disruption attempts.
