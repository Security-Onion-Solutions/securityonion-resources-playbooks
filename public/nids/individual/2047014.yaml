name: ET EXPLOIT Javascript Initiating Remote Server Search with Window's Search-MS URI Handler
id: 1212537
description: |
  Detects JavaScript that uses the search-ms URI handler to initiate remote server searches, potentially enabling access to remote file shares through Windows Explorer. May trigger on legitimate applications using Windows search functionality or development/testing environments.
