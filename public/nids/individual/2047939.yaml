name: ET EXPLOIT_KIT ClearFake Domain in TLS SNI (znqjdnqzdqzfqmfqmkfq .site)
id: 1242850
description: |
  Detects TLS connections to a specific ClearFake exploit kit domain. ClearFake campaigns use compromised
  websites to redirect users to fake update pages that deliver malware. Legitimate connections to this
  domain are unlikely but could occur through typosquatting or user misnavigation.
