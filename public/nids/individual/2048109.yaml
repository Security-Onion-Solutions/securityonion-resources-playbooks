name: ET EXPLOIT_KIT TA569 Keitaro TDS Domain in DNS Lookup (greedyclowns .org)
id: 1200133
description: |
  Detects DNS queries to greedyclowns.org, associated with TA569 Keitaro Traffic Distribution System (TDS).
  May indicate exploitation via compromised websites redirecting users through malicious TDS infrastructure.
  Could also trigger on security research or manual investigation of known bad domains.
