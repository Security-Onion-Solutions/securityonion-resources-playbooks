name: ET EXPLOIT_KIT Observed TOAD Domain (amz34.us in TLS SNI)
id: 1243965
description: |
  Detects TLS connections to domains ending in .amz34.us, associated with TOAD exploit kit infrastructure.
  May trigger on legitimate services using similar domain patterns or compromised websites redirecting to exploit kits.
