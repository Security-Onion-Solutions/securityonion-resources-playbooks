name: ET EXPLOIT_KIT DNS Query to TOAD Domain (300005 .ru)
id: 1212743
description: |
  Detects DNS queries to domains ending in .300005.ru, associated with the Telephone Oriented Attack Delivery (TOAD) framework.
  This technique uses legitimate RMM tools through phone-based social engineering to gain initial access.
