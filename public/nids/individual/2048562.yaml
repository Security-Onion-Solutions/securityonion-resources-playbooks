name: ET EXPLOIT_KIT Observed TOAD Domain (helpset123.site in TLS SNI)
id: 1203459
description: |
  Detects TLS connections to helpset123.site domain, which is associated with TOAD (Telephone Oriented Attack Delivery) infrastructure.
  May trigger on legitimate connections if the domain is repurposed or accessed for research purposes.
