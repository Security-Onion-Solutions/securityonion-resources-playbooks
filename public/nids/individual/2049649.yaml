name: ET HUNTING PDF extension in DNS TXT Response
id: 1224292
description: |
  Detects DNS TXT responses containing PDF file extensions, which may indicate DNS tunneling
  for data exfiltration or covert communications. May trigger on legitimate DNS configurations
  that include PDF references in TXT records.
