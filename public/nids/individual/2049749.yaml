name: ET MALWARE DNS Query to UAC-0177 Domain (ssl1.site)
id: 1256907
description: |
  Detects DNS queries to domains ending with ssl1.site, which are associated with UAC-0177 threat actor infrastructure.
  Legitimate SSL certificate services may use similar naming but should not match this specific pattern.
