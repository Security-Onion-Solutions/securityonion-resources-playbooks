id: 1216294
description: |
  Detects HTTP requests to URIs beginning with "/safebrowsing/dfKa/" that are not destined for legitimate Google services.
  May indicate Cobalt Strike C2 communications using a specific Blister Loader profile, but could also trigger on testing tools or other applications mimicking Google SafeBrowsing endpoints.
