name: ET MALWARE Observed Magecart Domain (beztech .site in TLS SNI)
id: 1234265
description: |
  Detects TLS connections to beztech.site domains, which have been observed hosting Magecart skimming infrastructure.
  May trigger on legitimate connections if the domain is later used for benign purposes.
