name: ET MALWARE DNS Query to Remcos Related Domain (myumysmeetr .ddns .net)
id: 1219690
description: |
  Detects DNS queries to domain associated with Remcos remote access trojan infrastructure.
  May indicate C2 communication or initial infection beacon. Could also trigger on legitimate
  DNS queries if the domain is later repurposed for benign use.
