name: ET EXPLOIT [TW] Possible MSXMLHTTP Request
id: 1245259
description: |
  Detects HTTP requests with MSIE 7.0 user-agent lacking referer and cookie headers, potentially indicating automated MSXMLHTTP requests.
  May trigger on legitimate applications, older browsers, or automated tools using this user-agent pattern.
