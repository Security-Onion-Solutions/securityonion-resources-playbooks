name: ET MALWARE Cryptbot CnC DGA Domain (thirt13)
id: 1234720
description: |
  Detects DNS queries matching Cryptbot DGA (Domain Generation Algorithm) patterns with "thirt13" strings.
  These domains are generated algorithmically for command and control communication. Legitimate queries to these domains are extremely unlikely.
