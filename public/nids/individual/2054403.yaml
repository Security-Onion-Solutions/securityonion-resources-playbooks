name: ET MALWARE Cryptbot CnC DGA Domain (sev7)
id: 1219037
description: |
  Detects DNS queries to domains matching Cryptbot stealer's Domain Generation Algorithm (DGA) pattern.
  This specific pattern uses "sev7" in .top domains and indicates communication with Cryptbot command and control infrastructure.
