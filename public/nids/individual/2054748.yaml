name: ET MALWARE Observed Zloader Related Domain (mafw.store in TLS SNI)
id: 1252073
description: |
  Detects TLS connections to domains ending in .mafw.store, associated with Zloader malware command and control infrastructure.
  May trigger on legitimate traffic if the domain is repurposed for non-malicious purposes.
