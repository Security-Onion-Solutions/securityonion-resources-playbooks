name: ET EXPLOIT_KIT ClearFake Domain in TLS SNI (dais7nsa .pics)
id: 1243410
description: |
  Detects TLS connections to the ClearFake campaign domain dais7nsa.pics.
  This domain is associated with clipboard compromise attacks that use PowerShell.
  May trigger on legitimate connections if the domain is later reused for benign purposes.
