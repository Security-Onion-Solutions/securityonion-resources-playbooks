name: ET MALWARE SocGholish CnC Domain in DNS (*.therapy.emergencpsychservices.com)
id: 1249900
description: |
  Detects DNS queries to SocGholish command and control domains using the therapy.emergencpsychservices.com pattern.
  May trigger on legitimate DNS queries if the domain is used for actual services, though this is unlikely given the malware association.
