name: ET MALWARE Observed Emmenhtal Loader Domain (mato2.b-cdn.net in TLS SNI)
id: 1234952
description: |
  Detects TLS connections to mato2.b-cdn.net associated with Emmenhtal loader distributing commodity infostealers.
  May trigger on legitimate CDN usage if the domain is repurposed for benign content delivery.
