name: ET WEB_SPECIFIC_APPS Apache HugeGraph Gremlin SecurityManager Reflection Filter Bypass (CVE-2024-27348)
id: 1201940
description: |
  Detects POST requests to Apache HugeGraph /gremlin endpoint containing reflection-based payloads that attempt to bypass SecurityManager restrictions.
  May trigger on legitimate Gremlin queries using reflection or security testing tools.
