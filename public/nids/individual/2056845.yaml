name: ET MALWARE Observed DNS Query to Rogue RDP (UAC-0215) Domain (gov-lt .cloud)
id: 1236612
description: |
  Detects DNS queries to domains ending in .gov-lt.cloud associated with Rogue RDP malware campaigns.
  May trigger on legitimate queries if domains are registered for benign purposes, though this TLD pattern is uncommon for legitimate services.
