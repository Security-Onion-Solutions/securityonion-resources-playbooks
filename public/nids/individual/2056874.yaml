name: ET MALWARE Observed DNS Query to Rogue RDP (UAC-0215) Domain (md-gov .cloud)
id: 1236626
description: |
  Detects DNS queries to domains ending in .md-gov.cloud, which are associated with UAC-0215 threat actor's rogue RDP infrastructure.
  May trigger on legitimate queries if similar domain patterns are used by authorized services.
