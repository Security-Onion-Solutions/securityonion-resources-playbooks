name: ET MALWARE Observed DNS Query to Rogue RDP (UAC-0215) Domain (s3-dk .cloud)
id: 1236646
description: |
  Detects DNS queries to s3-dk.cloud domains associated with UAC-0215 threat group's rogue RDP infrastructure.
  May trigger on legitimate DNS queries if the domain is later repurposed for benign services.
