name: ET MALWARE Observed Rogue RDP (UAC-0215) Domain (mv-gov.cloud in TLS SNI)
id: 1219292
description: |
  Detects TLS connections to domains ending with .mv-gov.cloud, which are associated with UAC-0215 rogue RDP infrastructure.
  May trigger on legitimate connections if organizations use similar domain patterns or during security research activities.
