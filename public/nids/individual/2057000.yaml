name: ET MALWARE Observed Rogue RDP (UAC-0215) Domain in TLS SNI
id: 1236719
description: |
  Detects TLS connections to domains matching the pattern "us-west-2-aws.mfa-gov.cloud" associated with UAC-0215 threat group.
  This specific domain pattern is used by threat actors for command and control communications disguised as legitimate AWS infrastructure.
