name: ET HUNTING Symbolic Link (SLK) Excel XLM Macro
id: 1217614
description: |
  Detects HTTP responses containing SLK (Symbolic Link) Excel files with XLM macros.
  These files can bypass security controls and execute malicious macros. May trigger on
  legitimate Excel files using the older SLK format for data exchange.
