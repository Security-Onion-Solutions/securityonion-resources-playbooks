name: ET EXPLOIT_KIT Malicious TA2726 TDS Domain in TLS SNI (leatherbook .org)
id: 1211597
description: |
  Detects TLS connections to leatherbook.org, identified as part of TA2726 traffic distribution system (TDS) infrastructure.
  May trigger on legitimate access if the domain is later repurposed or during security research activities.
