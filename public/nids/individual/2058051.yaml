name: ET HUNTING JavaScript Engine JIT Forcing Observed - Investigate Possible Exploitation M1
id: 1247495
description: |
  Detects JavaScript patterns that may force JIT (Just-In-Time) compilation optimization,
  potentially indicating exploitation attempts against JavaScript engine vulnerabilities.
  May trigger on legitimate web applications using performance optimization techniques.
