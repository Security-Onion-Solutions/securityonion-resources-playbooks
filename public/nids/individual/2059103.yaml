name: ET INFO SMBv2 Protocol Create Operation Observed
id: 1257786
description: |
  Detects SMB version 2 protocol create operations, which occur during normal file sharing, network resource access, or administrative activities.
  May indicate legitimate file operations or administrative tasks, but could also reveal lateral movement or reconnaissance activities.
