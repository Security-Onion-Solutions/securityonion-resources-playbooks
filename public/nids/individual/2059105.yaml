name: ET INFO SMBv2 Protocol Flush Operation Observed
id: 1257788
description: |
  Detects SMBv2 flush operations which are part of normal file system operations but may indicate file manipulation activities.
  Can occur during legitimate file saves, system cleanup, or potentially during data staging activities.
