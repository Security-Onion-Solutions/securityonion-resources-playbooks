name: ET INFO SMBv2 Protocol Cancel Operation Observed
id: 1257793
description: |
  Detects SMBv2 protocol cancel operations, which can occur during normal network interruptions,
  application timeouts, or when clients terminate file operations. May also indicate reconnaissance
  or exploitation attempts targeting SMB services.
