name: ET WEB_SPECIFIC_APPS Next.js Forced Caching via x-now-route-matches HTTP Header (CVE-2024-46982)
id: 1223125
description: |
  Detects HTTP requests containing the x-now-route-matches header which can be used to force caching in Next.js applications.
  May trigger on legitimate Next.js applications using this header for proper caching behavior or during application testing.
