name: ET MALWARE J-magic (nfsiod) Backdoor Magic Packet Inbound Request M2
id: 1249970
description: |
  Detects inbound TCP SYN packets on port 443 from external sources that contain specific byte patterns consistent with J-magic backdoor magic packet communications.
  May trigger on legitimate TCP connections with similar byte sequences or network reconnaissance activities.
