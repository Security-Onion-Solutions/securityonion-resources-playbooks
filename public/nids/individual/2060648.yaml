name: ET MALWARE Observed Malicious BOINC Server Domain (rosetta .cn in TLS SNI)
id: 1231124
description: |
  Detects TLS connections to BOINC server domains using .rosetta.cn which are associated with GhostWeaver backdoor infrastructure.
  Legitimate BOINC projects typically use official domains, making connections to .rosetta.cn suspicious.
