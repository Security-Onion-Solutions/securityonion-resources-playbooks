name: ET MALWARE DuvetStealer C2 (send-token) Traffic Outbound
id: 1231494
description: |
  Detects HTTP POST requests to "/api/send-token" endpoint with specific patterns matching DuvetStealer malware C2 communications.
  May trigger on legitimate API traffic that shares similar structure with token-based authentication systems.
