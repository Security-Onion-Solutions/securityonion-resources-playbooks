name: ET WEB_SPECIFIC_APPS D-Link DIR-823G Multiple HNAP SOAPAction Endpoints Authentication Bypass (CVE-2025-2359, CVE-2025-2360)
id: 1223153
description: |
  Detects POST requests to D-Link DIR-823G HNAP endpoints with SetDDNSSettings or SetUpnpSettings operations that bypass authentication.
  May trigger on legitimate router administration or network management tools accessing HNAP services.
