name: ET WEB_SPECIFIC_APPS BentoML Unauthenticated Remote Command Execution via Insecure Deserialization (CVE-2025-27520)
id: 1220661
description: |
  Detects POST requests to BentoML with pickle content type and serialized data headers that match CVE-2025-27520 exploitation patterns.
  May trigger on legitimate BentoML model deployments that use pickle serialization or authorized API interactions.
