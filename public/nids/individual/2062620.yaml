name: ET WEB_SPECIFIC_APPS Apache CXF Aegis DataBinding Server-Side Request Forgery (CVE-2024-28752)
id: 1223170
description: |
  Detects POST requests with SOAP action headers containing XOP Include elements with URI schemes that may indicate SSRF exploitation attempts against Apache CXF Aegis DataBinding.
  May trigger on legitimate SOAP requests using XOP (XML-binary Optimized Packaging) or security scanning tools.
