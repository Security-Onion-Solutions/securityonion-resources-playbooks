name: ET WEB_SPECIFIC_APPS Totolink formFilter ip6addr Parameter Buffer Overflow Attempt (CVE-2025-5907)
id: 1223176
description: |
  Detects POST requests to Totolink router formFilter endpoint with oversized ip6addr parameter that may trigger buffer overflow vulnerability CVE-2025-5907.
  May trigger on legitimate configuration attempts with unusually long IPv6 addresses or security testing tools.
