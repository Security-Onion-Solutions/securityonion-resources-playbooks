name: ET INFO External IP Lookup Domain (ipconfig.io) in DNS Lookup
id: 1204962
description: |
  Detects DNS queries to ipconfig.io, a service that returns the external IP address of the querying host.
  May indicate legitimate IP address discovery for network troubleshooting or system administration, but could also suggest reconnaissance activity or malware attempting to determine external network positioning.
