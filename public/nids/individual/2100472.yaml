name: GPL ICMP redirect host
id: 1248623
description: |
  Detects ICMP redirect host messages from external sources. These messages instruct hosts to use different routes for traffic but can be used to redirect traffic through attacker-controlled systems. May be legitimate network administration traffic or result from misconfigured routing equipment.

  - question: What host received the ICMP redirect and what was the target route?
    context: Determines which internal system was instructed to change routing and the destination.

  - question: Did the receiving host change its routing behavior after this message?
    context: Assesses whether the ICMP redirect was acted upon by the target system.
