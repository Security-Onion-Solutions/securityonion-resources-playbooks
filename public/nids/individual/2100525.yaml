name: GPL INFO udp port 0 traffic
id: 1247675
description: |
  Detects UDP traffic involving port 0, which is not assigned to any service and may indicate network scanning, protocol errors, or potential evasion techniques.
  Can occur from legitimate network diagnostics, misconfigurations, or applications using port 0 for special purposes.
