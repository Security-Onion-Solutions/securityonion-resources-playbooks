id: 1248772
description: |
  Detects SGI NOOP sled patterns in network traffic, which are commonly used in buffer overflow exploits targeting SGI systems.
  May trigger on legitimate binary data transfers or compressed content containing similar byte patterns.

questions:
  - question: What was the complete traffic flow containing the SGI NOOP pattern?
    context: Understanding the full packet reveals exploitation context and payload structure.
