name: GPL DELETED successful gobbles ssh exploit uname
id: 1248935
description: |
  Detects SSH sessions where "uname" output is returned to client, potentially indicating successful exploitation of SSH vulnerabilities CVE-2002-0390 or CVE-2002-0639.
  May also trigger on legitimate SSH sessions where users execute uname commands.
