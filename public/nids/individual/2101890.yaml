name: GPL DELETED status GHBN format string attack
id: 1248528
description: |
  Detects UDP packets containing specific binary patterns and format string indicators that match historical GHBN (Get Host By Name) service exploitation attempts.
  May trigger on legitimate network services using similar binary protocols or diagnostic tools.
