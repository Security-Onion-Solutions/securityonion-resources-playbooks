name: GPL SNMP null community string attempt
id: 1228359
description: |
  Detects SNMP requests using null community strings, which may indicate reconnaissance
  or attempts to access devices with default configurations. Can also trigger on
  legitimate network monitoring tools or misconfigured SNMP clients.
