name: GPL FTP PASS overflow attempt
id: 1227187
description: |
  Detects FTP password authentication attempts with unusually long password fields that may indicate buffer overflow exploitation attempts.
  May trigger on legitimate applications using very long passwords or automated tools with verbose password strings.
