name: GPL RPC CMSD UDP CMSD_CREATE Array Buffer Overflow Attempt
id: 1248707

  Detects UDP traffic targeting the CDE Calendar Manager Service Daemon (CMSD) with patterns
  matching buffer overflow exploitation attempts. May trigger on legitimate RPC communications
  or network scanning tools probing for RPC services.
