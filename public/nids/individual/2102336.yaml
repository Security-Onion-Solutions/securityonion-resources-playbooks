name: GPL TFTP NULL Command Attempt
id: 1248696
description: |
  Detects TFTP packets containing NULL command bytes that may indicate protocol abuse or malformed requests.
  May trigger on legitimate TFTP client implementations with non-standard formatting or network issues causing packet corruption.
