name: GPL EXPLOIT ISAKMP fifth payload certificate request length overflow attempt
id: 1248738
description: |
  Detects UDP traffic on port 500 containing ISAKMP certificate request payloads with excessive length values.
  May trigger on legitimate VPN negotiations with large certificate chains or malformed ISAKMP implementations.
