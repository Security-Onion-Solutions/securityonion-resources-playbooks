name: GPL EXPLOIT ISAKMP second payload initial contact notification without SPI attempt
id: 1248743
description: |
  Detects ISAKMP (Internet Security Association and Key Management Protocol) packets with malformed second payload initial contact notifications that lack proper SPI (Security Parameter Index) values. This pattern may indicate exploitation attempts against VPN gateway implementations or legitimate but misconfigured ISAKMP negotiations.
