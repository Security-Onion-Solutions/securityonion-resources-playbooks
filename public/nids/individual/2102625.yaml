name: GPL SQL unregister_user_repgroup ordered privilege_type buffer overflow attempt
id: 1210625
description: |
  Detects Oracle SQL requests using dbms_repcat_admin.unregister_user_repgroup with long parameter values that may indicate buffer overflow exploitation attempts.
  Could also trigger on legitimate Oracle database administration operations or application debugging activities.
