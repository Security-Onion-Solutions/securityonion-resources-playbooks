name: GPL SQL service_name buffer overflow attempt
id: 1203328
description: |
  Detects Oracle TNS connection attempts with unusually long service_name parameters that may indicate buffer overflow exploitation.
  May trigger on legitimate Oracle applications with long service names or configuration errors.
