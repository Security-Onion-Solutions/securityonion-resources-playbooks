name: GPL SQL dbms_offline_og.begin_instantiation buffer overflow attempt
id: 1216566
description: |
  Detects Oracle SQL queries containing dbms_offline_og.begin_instantiation with oversized parameters that may indicate buffer overflow exploitation attempts.
  May trigger on legitimate Oracle database operations with large parameter values or database administration activities.
