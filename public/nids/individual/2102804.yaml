id: 1216712
description: |
  Detects attempts to exploit a buffer overflow vulnerability in Oracle's dbms_repcat.send_and_compare_old_values procedure using excessively long string parameters.
  May trigger on legitimate database operations with large parameter values or database security testing tools.
