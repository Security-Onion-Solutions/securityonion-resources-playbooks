name: GPL NETBIOS SMB-DS llsrpc unicode little endian andx bind attempt
id: 1227636
description: |
  Detects SMB connections attempting to bind to the llsrpc (Local Security Authority RPC) service using unicode little endian encoding.
  This could indicate legitimate administrative tools or potential reconnaissance for privilege escalation attacks.
