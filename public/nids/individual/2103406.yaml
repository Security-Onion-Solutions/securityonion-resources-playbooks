name: GPL NETBIOS SMB-DS ISystemActivator little endian andx bind attempt
id: 1216476
description: |
  Detects SMB-DS ISystemActivator bind attempts using little endian format. ISystemActivator is a Windows DCOM interface that can be used for legitimate remote system administration but is also commonly exploited for lateral movement and remote code execution in attack scenarios.
