name: GPL NETBIOS SMB-DS ISystemActivator unicode andx bind attempt
id: 1211175
description: |
  Detects DCE/RPC bind requests to the ISystemActivator interface over SMB. This interface allows for remote activation of DCOM objects. May occur during legitimate DCOM-based applications or during lateral movement attempts using DCOM.
