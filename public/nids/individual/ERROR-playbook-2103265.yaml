name: GPL NETBIOS SMB-DS IrotIsRunning Little Endian Attempt (CVE-2002-1561)
id: 22103265
description: |
  Detects little-endian encoded attempts to exploit CVE-2002-1561 through IrotIsRunning interface calls via SMB.
  This variant uses little-endian byte ordering which may indicate specific exploitation tools or evasion techniques.
  May trigger on legitimate DCOM applications using little-endian encoding or cross-platform distributed systems.
