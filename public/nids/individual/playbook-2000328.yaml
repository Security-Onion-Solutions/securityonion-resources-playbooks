name: ET INFO Outbound Multiple Non-SMTP Server Emails
id: 22000328
description: |
  Detects internal systems sending multiple emails to external non-SMTP servers.
  This may indicate malware exfiltration, botnet activity, or unauthorized email relay.
  Can trigger on legitimate applications using direct SMTP connections or backup mail routes.
