name: ET P2P BitTorrent peer sync
id: 22000334
description: |
  Detects BitTorrent peer synchronization traffic indicating peer-to-peer file sharing activity.
  May be legitimate in environments where P2P is authorized, but often violates corporate policy.
  Can also indicate malware using BitTorrent protocol for C2 communication.
