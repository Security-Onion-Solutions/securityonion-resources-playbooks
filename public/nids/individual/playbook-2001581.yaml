name: ET SCAN Behavioral Unusual Port 135 traffic Potential Scan or Infection
id: 22001581
description: |
  Detects unusual RPC Endpoint Mapper traffic patterns indicating potential network scanning or malware infection.
  Port 135/TCP is used by Windows RPC services for dynamic port allocation and service enumeration.
  May trigger on legitimate system administration tools or Windows service discovery.
