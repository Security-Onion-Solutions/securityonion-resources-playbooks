name: ET MALWARE Turkojan C&C Info Command Response (MINFO)
id: 22008023
description: |
  Detects Turkojan trojan command and control communication containing MINFO command response.
  This indicates an infected system responding to C&C server information requests.
  Legitimate applications do not typically use this specific command pattern.
