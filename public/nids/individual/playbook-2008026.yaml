name: ET MALWARE Turkojan C&C Keepalive (BAGLANTI)
id: 22008026
description: |
  Detects Turkojan RAT sending keepalive messages with "BAGLANTI?" to maintain C2 connection.
  This indicates active RAT session with established command and control communication.
  "BAGLANTI" is Turkish for "connection" - characteristic of Turkojan malware family.
