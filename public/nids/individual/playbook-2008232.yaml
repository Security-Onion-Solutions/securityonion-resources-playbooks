name: ET MALWARE Generic Spambot (often Tibs) Post-Infection Checkin
id: 22008232
description: |
  Detects generic spambot malware performing post-infection check-ins to command and control servers.
  The base64-encoded URI pattern is characteristic of Tibs and similar spambot families.
  Legitimate applications rarely use such encoded URI patterns for normal communication.
