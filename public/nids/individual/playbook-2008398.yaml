name: ET MALWARE Fullspace.cc or Related Checkin (2)
id: 22008398
description: |
  Detects HTTP requests to registration endpoints with parameter patterns associated with Fullspace.cc malware family.
  The combination of parameters (id, port, connect, ver, ip) indicates botnet registration and check-in activity.
  Legitimate applications do not typically use this specific parameter combination for registration purposes.
