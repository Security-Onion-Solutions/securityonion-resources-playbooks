name: ET NETBIOS Microsoft Windows NETAPI Stack Overflow Inbound - MS08-067 (23)
id: 22008713
description: |
  Detects MS08-067 exploitation attempts targeting NETAPI stack overflow vulnerability via SMB on port 445.
  This variant uses Unix-style directory traversal patterns (../) in the exploit payload.
  Legitimate SMB traffic should not contain these specific path traversal sequences.
