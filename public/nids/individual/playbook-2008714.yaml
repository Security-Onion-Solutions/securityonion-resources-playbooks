name: ET NETBIOS Microsoft Windows NETAPI Stack Overflow Inbound - MS08-067 (24)
id: 22008714
description: |
  Detects MS08-067 exploitation attempts targeting NETAPI stack overflow vulnerability via SMB on port 445.
  This variant uses Windows-style Unicode directory traversal patterns in the exploit payload.
  Legitimate SMB traffic should not contain these specific malformed Unicode path sequences.
