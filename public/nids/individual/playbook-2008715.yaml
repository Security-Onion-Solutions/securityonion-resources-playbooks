name: ET NETBIOS Microsoft Windows NETAPI Stack Overflow Inbound - MS08-067 (25)
id: 22008715
description: |
  Detects MS08-067 exploitation attempts targeting NETAPI stack overflow vulnerability via SMB on port 445.
  This variant uses Windows-style Unicode backslash directory traversal patterns in the exploit payload.
  Legitimate SMB traffic should not contain these specific malformed Unicode backslash sequences.
