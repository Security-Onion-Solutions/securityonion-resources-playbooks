name: ET NETBIOS Microsoft Windows NETAPI Stack Overflow Inbound - MS08-067 (28)
id: 22008718
description: |
  Detects MS08-067 exploitation attempts targeting NETAPI stack overflow vulnerability via SMB on port 139.
  This variant uses standard ASCII directory traversal patterns (../../) in the exploit payload.
  Legitimate SMB traffic should not contain these specific path traversal sequences targeting system vulnerabilities.
