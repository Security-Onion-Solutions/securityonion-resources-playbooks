name: ET MALWARE Common Trojan HTTP GET Logging
id: 22009451
description: |
  Detects HTTP GET requests with parameter patterns commonly used by trojans for system information logging.
  The combination of parameters (type, setup_id, version, os, sp) indicates malware collecting system information.
  Legitimate applications may occasionally use similar parameters but rarely in this exact combination.
