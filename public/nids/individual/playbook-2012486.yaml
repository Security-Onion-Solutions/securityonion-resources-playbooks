questions:
  - question: What was the complete UNION SELECT payload structure in the ctf parameter?
    context: UNION SELECT injections reveal the attacker's specific data extraction strategy and target columns.
    query: |
      aggregation: false
      logsource:
        category: alert
      detection:
        selection:

      fields:
        - http.request.body.content
        - url.full
        - http.request.method

  - question: How many columns were being extracted via the UNION SELECT statement?
    context: Column count reveals the scope of data extraction and helps identify target database schema.

  - question: Is there any legitimate reason for UNION SELECT in this application context?
    context: UNION SELECT is almost never legitimate in user input, making this a high-confidence indicator.
