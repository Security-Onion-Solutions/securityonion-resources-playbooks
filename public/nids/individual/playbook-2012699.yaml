name: ET WEB_SPECIFIC_APPS eGroupware loaddetails.php script DELETE FROM SQL Injection Attempt
id: 22012699
description: |
  Detects SQL injection attempts targeting eGroupware's loaddetails.php script using DELETE FROM statements.
  This could indicate an attacker attempting to delete database records or extract information through error-based injection.
  May trigger on legitimate database maintenance operations if parameters are passed through the web interface.
