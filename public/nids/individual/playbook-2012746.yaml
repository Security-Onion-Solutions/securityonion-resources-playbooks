  # Type 1: Artifact Analysis
  - question: What specific DELETE FROM SQL payload was injected in the id parameter?
    context: The exact deletion query reveals which tables and data the attacker targeted for destruction.
    query: |
      aggregation: false
      logsource:
        category: alert
