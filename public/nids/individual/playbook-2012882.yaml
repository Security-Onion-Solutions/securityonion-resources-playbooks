id: 22012882
description: |
  Detects Backdoor.Win32.Poison.AU malware performing check-in communication with command and control server.
  This backdoor uses specific MIME-Version headers and encrypted content patterns for C&C communication.
  Legitimate applications do not use this specific communication pattern.
