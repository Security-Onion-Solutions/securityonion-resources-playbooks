name: ET USER_AGENTS Suspicious User-Agent Fragment (WORKED)
id: 22012909
description: |
  Detects HTTP requests containing the suspicious user-agent fragment "WORKED".
  This pattern is commonly associated with malware and automated tools.
  Legitimate applications rarely use such obvious success indicators in user-agent strings.
