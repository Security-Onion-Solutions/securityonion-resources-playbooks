name: ET MALWARE Backdoor.Meciv Checkin
id: 22013212
description: |
  Detects Backdoor.Meciv malware performing checkin communications to command and control servers.
  The malware uses a specific URI pattern "/trandocs/netstat" for C2 communications.
  May trigger on legitimate applications using similar URI patterns, though this specific path is highly suspicious.
