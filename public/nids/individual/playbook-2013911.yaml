name: ET MALWARE P2P Zeus or ZeroAccess Request To CnC
id: 22013911
description: |
  Detects Zeus or ZeroAccess botnet command and control communication based on specific binary patterns.
  This signature identifies P2P botnet traffic with distinctive 20-byte payloads containing known malware fingerprints.
  Legitimate applications rarely use these specific binary sequences in network communications.
