name: ET MALWARE Gootkit Checkin User-Agent 2
id: 22014021
description: |
  Detects Gootkit banking trojan command and control communications via distinctive User-Agent header.
  The malware uses "Gootkit ldr" in HTTP headers to communicate with C2 servers.
  Legitimate software would not use this specific User-Agent string.
