id: 22014320
description: |
  Detects cross-site scripting (XSS) attempts targeting the ButorWiki service parameter in SSO signin functionality.
  The attack injects malicious JavaScript or HTML content through the service parameter to execute client-side code.
  May trigger on legitimate applications using similar parameter patterns with HTML/JavaScript content.
