name: ET MALWARE Zbot CnC GET /lost.dat
id: 22014980
description: |
  Detects Zeus/Zbot malware command and control communication via GET requests to /lost.dat endpoint.
  This specific URI pattern is used by Zbot variants to download configuration files or receive commands from C&C servers. Legitimate applications do not typically access .dat files over HTTP.
