  - question: Did the server attempt to fetch the malicious remote file?
    context: Successful RFI requires the server to make outbound connections to attacker-controlled resources.

  - question: Was the remote file inclusion attempt successful based on server response?
    context: Response size and status codes indicate whether malicious code was included and executed.
    range: +5m

        - http.response.bytes
        - http.response.body.content

  - question: Are there signs of code execution following the RFI attempt?
    context: Successful RFI often leads to web shell deployment or additional malicious activity.

        - http.request.body.content

  - question: What other PHP applications were targeted with similar RFI attempts?
    context: Attackers often use automated tools to target multiple PHP applications with RFI vulnerabilities.
