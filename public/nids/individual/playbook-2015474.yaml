name: ET MALWARE ZeroAccess udp traffic detected
id: 22015474
description: |
  Detects ZeroAccess botnet UDP communication based on specific binary patterns.
  This signature identifies ZeroAccess P2P botnet traffic using UDP protocol with distinctive 20-byte payloads.
  Legitimate applications rarely use these specific binary sequences in UDP communications to port 53.
