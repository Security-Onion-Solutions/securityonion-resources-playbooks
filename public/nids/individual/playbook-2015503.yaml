name: ET MALWARE ProxyBox - HTTP CnC - .com.tw/check_version.php
id: 22015503
description: |
  Detects ProxyBox malware communicating with command and control servers via HTTP requests to check_version.php on .com.tw domains.
  May trigger on legitimate software update checks to Taiwanese domains, but the specific URI pattern is highly suspicious.
