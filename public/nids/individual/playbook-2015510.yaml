name: ET MALWARE ProxyBox - ProxyBotCommand - I_AM
id: 22015510
description: |
  Detects ProxyBox proxy bot malware announcing its presence with "I_AM" command.
  This signature identifies proxy bot registration or status communication to command and control servers.
  Legitimate applications do not typically send "I_AM" commands followed by CRLF in network communications.
