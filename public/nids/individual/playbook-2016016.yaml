name: ET DOS DNS Amplification Attack Inbound
id: 22016016
description: |
  Detects inbound DNS amplification attacks where attackers abuse DNS servers to amplify traffic toward targets.
  Large DNS responses (>4095 bytes) to small queries indicate potential amplification abuse.
  Legitimate DNS queries typically don't generate responses of this size unless specifically configured.
