name: ET EXPLOIT IPMI Cipher 0 Authentication mode set
id: 22017094
description: |
  Detects IPMI exploitation attempts using Cipher 0 (no authentication) mode.
  This vulnerability allows attackers to bypass authentication on IPMI interfaces.
  Legitimate IPMI should use proper authentication ciphers, not Cipher 0.
