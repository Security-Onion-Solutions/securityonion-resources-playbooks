name: ET MALWARE Backdoor family PCRat/Gh0st CnC traffic (OUTBOUND) 3
id: 22017548
description: |
  Detects outbound command-and-control traffic from PCRat/Gh0st malware families.
  These RATs establish persistent backdoor access for remote system control.
  Legitimate software rarely exhibits similar binary communication patterns.
