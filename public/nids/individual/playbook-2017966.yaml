name: ET DOS Likely NTP DDoS In Progress MON_LIST Response to Non-Ephemeral Port IMPL 0x03
id: 22017966
description: |
  Detects NTP amplification DDoS attacks using MON_LIST responses sent to non-ephemeral ports.
  This signature identifies NTP servers being abused to amplify traffic toward victim systems.
  Legitimate NTP responses typically go to ephemeral ports (32768-65535), not privileged ports.
