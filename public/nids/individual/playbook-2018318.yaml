name: ET SCAN NMAP SIP Version Detection Script Activity
id: 22018318
description: |
  Detects NMAP SIP version detection script activity with characteristic Via and From headers.
  This indicates automated reconnaissance targeting SIP services on standard ports 5060-5061.
  Legitimate SIP clients would not use the specific "nm@nm" pattern characteristic of NMAP scanning.
