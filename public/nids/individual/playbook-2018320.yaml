name: ET MALWARE Win32/Sisproc
id: 22018320
description: |
  Detects Win32/Sisproc malware communication patterns with characteristic HTTP requests containing specific cookie values.
  This malware was observed in spear-phishing campaigns leveraging interest in Malaysian Flight MH-370 disappearance.
  Legitimate web traffic would not contain the specific "XX=0; BX=0" cookie pattern used by this malware.
