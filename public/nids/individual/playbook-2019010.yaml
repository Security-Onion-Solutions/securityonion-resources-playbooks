name: ET DOS Likely NTP DDoS In Progress PEER_LIST Response to Non-Ephemeral Port IMPL 0x02
id: 22019010
description: |
  Detects NTP amplification DDoS attacks using PEER_LIST queries with implementation 0x02.
  Attackers exploit NTP servers to amplify traffic by sending small queries that generate large responses.
  Responses to non-ephemeral ports (0-1023) indicate spoofed source addresses in DDoS attacks.
