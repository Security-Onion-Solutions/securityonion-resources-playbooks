name: ET DOS Likely NTP DDoS In Progress PEER_LIST_SUM Response to Non-Ephemeral Port IMPL 0x02
id: 22019012
description: |
  Detects NTP amplification DDoS attacks using PEER_LIST_SUM responses sent to non-ephemeral ports.
  May trigger on legitimate NTP synchronization traffic, but responses to low ports indicate abuse.

questions:
  - question: What was the exact NTP response packet structure and implementation code?
    context: Understanding the packet format confirms this is a PEER_LIST_SUM response with implementation 0x02.

  - question: Is this NTP server authorized to respond to requests from this destination?
    context: Legitimate NTP servers should only respond to authorized clients and not to random low ports.

  - question: What initiated the NTP request that generated this response?
    context: DDoS attacks use spoofed source IPs, so the original request may show attack infrastructure.

  - question: What is the volume and frequency of NTP responses from this source?
    context: DDoS amplification attacks generate high volumes of responses in short timeframes.

      fields:
        - dst_ip
        - dst_port
        - bytes_toclient

  - question: Are multiple NTP servers participating in this amplification attack?
    context: Coordinated DDoS attacks often abuse multiple NTP servers simultaneously.

        - dst_ip
        - dst_port

  - question: What is the amplification ratio of this attack?
    context: NTP amplification can achieve high ratios, making small requests generate large responses.
    range: -30m

        - packets_toserver
        - packets_toclient

  - question: Has the target destination shown signs of service degradation?
    context: Successful DDoS attacks cause network congestion and service availability issues.
    range: -1h

        - dst_port
        - bytes_toclient

  - question: Are there other amplification attack vectors targeting the same destination?
    context: Multi-vector DDoS attacks combine NTP with DNS, SNMP, and other protocols.
