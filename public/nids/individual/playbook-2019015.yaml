name: ET DOS Likely NTP DDoS In Progress GET_RESTRICT Response to Non-Ephemeral Port IMPL 0x02
id: 22019015
description: |
  Detects NTP GET_RESTRICT responses being sent to non-ephemeral ports, indicating potential NTP amplification DDoS attacks.
  Legitimate NTP responses should go to ephemeral ports (1024+), not privileged ports (0-1023).
