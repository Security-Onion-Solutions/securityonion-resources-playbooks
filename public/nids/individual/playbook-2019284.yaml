name: ET ATTACK_RESPONSE Output of id command from HTTP server
id: 22019284
description: |
  Detects output of Unix 'id' command being transmitted from HTTP servers indicating potential web shell activity.
  Identifies uid/gid/groups output pattern suggesting successful command injection or web shell execution.
  May trigger on legitimate system administration tools that display user information via web interfaces.
