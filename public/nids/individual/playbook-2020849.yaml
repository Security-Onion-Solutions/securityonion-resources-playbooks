name: ET MALWARE TinyLoader.B1 Checkin x86
id: 22020849
description: |
  Detects TinyLoader.B1 malware performing x86 architecture checkin communications.
  This malware family uses specific 12-byte UDP packets with hardcoded signatures for command and control.
  Legitimate applications would not generate this exact packet structure and size.
