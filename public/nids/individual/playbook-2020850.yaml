name: ET MALWARE TinyLoader.B1 Checkin x64
id: 22020850
description: |
  Detects TinyLoader.B1 malware performing x64 architecture checkin communications.
  This malware family uses specific 12-byte UDP packets with hardcoded signatures for command and control.
  The x64 variant uses a different signature byte (0x86) compared to the x86 version.
