name: ET MALWARE TinyLoader.B2 Checkin no architecture
id: 22020851
description: |
  Detects TinyLoader.B2 malware performing architecture-agnostic checkin communications.
  This variant uses a different signature byte (0x84) and does not specify x86 or x64 architecture.
  Represents an evolution of the TinyLoader family with simplified architecture handling.
