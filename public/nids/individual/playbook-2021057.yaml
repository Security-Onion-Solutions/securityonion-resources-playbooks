name: ET MALWARE njRAT Variant Outbound CnC Beacon
id: 22021057
description: |
  Detects outbound communication from njRAT malware variants attempting to establish command and control channels.
  The signature pattern "|7c|nj-q8" is specific to njRAT beacons and indicates compromised system communicating with attacker infrastructure.
  Legitimate applications would not generate this specific pattern.
