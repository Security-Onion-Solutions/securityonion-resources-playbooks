name: ET DOS Possible Sentinal LM Amplification attack (Request) Inbound
id: 22021172
description: |
  Detects small UDP requests to Sentinel License Manager that may be used for amplification attacks.
  These 6-byte requests can trigger large responses, making them attractive for DDoS amplification.
  May trigger on legitimate license client requests during normal software operation.
