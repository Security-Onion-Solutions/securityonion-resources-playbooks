name: ET MALWARE NetWire Variant - Server Directory Listing Request
id: 22021979
description: |
  Detects NetWire RAT server directory listing requests in established TCP connections.
  NetWire is a commercial remote access tool often used maliciously for data theft and system control.
  May rarely trigger on legitimate remote administration tools with similar binary protocols.
