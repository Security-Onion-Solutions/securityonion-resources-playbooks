name: ET MALWARE ELF.MrBlack DOS.TF Malformed Lookup (/lib32/libc.so.6)
id: 22022335
description: |
  Detects ELF.MrBlack malware performing malformed DNS lookups for /lib32/libc.so.6.
  This indicates DDoS malware attempting to resolve library files as domain names.
  Legitimate systems would never perform DNS lookups for local library paths.
