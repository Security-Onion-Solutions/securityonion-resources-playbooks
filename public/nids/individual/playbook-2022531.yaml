name: ET EXPLOIT Possible CVE-2015-7547 Malformed Server Response
id: 22022531
description: |
  Detects potential exploitation of CVE-2015-7547, a buffer overflow vulnerability in glibc's DNS resolver.
  Malicious DNS responses with specific malformed patterns can trigger stack-based buffer overflows.
  Legitimate DNS servers should not send responses matching these specific malformation patterns.
