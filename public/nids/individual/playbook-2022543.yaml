name: ET EXPLOIT Possible CVE-2015-7547 Long Response to A lookup
id: 22022543
description: |
  Detects abnormally long DNS A record responses that may exploit CVE-2015-7547.
  This glibc vulnerability is triggered by DNS responses exceeding buffer limits.
  Legitimate DNS servers should not send A record responses of this size.
