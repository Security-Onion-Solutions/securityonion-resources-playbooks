name: ET EXPLOIT Dameware DMRC Buffer Overflow Attempt (CVE-2016-2345)
id: 22022712
description: |
  Detects buffer overflow exploitation attempts against Dameware Mini Remote Control (DMRC) service on port 6129.
  CVE-2016-2345 allows remote code execution through malformed packets containing NOP sleds and shellcode.
  May trigger on legitimate DMRC traffic with unusual packet structures or corrupted data.
