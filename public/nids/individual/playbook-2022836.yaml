name: ET MALWARE PowerShell/Agent.A DNS Checkin
id: 22022836
description: |
  Detects PowerShell/Agent.A malware performing DNS-based command and control checkins.
  Uses encoded DNS queries to communicate with C2 infrastructure.
  Legitimate PowerShell scripts would not generate these specific encoded DNS patterns.
