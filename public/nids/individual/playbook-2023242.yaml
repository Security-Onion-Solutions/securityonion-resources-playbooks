name: ET MALWARE LuminosityLink - Outbound Data Channel CnC Delimiter
id: 22023242
description: |
  Detects outbound LuminosityLink RAT communication containing the distinctive "8_=_8" delimiter pattern.
  This signature indicates a compromised system sending data or responses back to the attacker's command and control server.
  The small payload size with specific delimiter is characteristic of LuminosityLink's communication protocol.
