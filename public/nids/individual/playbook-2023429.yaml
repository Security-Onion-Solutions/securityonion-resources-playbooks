name: ET MALWARE Houdini/Hworm CnC Checkin M1
id: 22023429
description: |
  Detects Houdini/Hworm malware performing initial check-in communication with command and control servers.
  The "new_houdini" string followed by specific carriage return/line feed patterns is characteristic of this RAT family's registration protocol.
  Legitimate applications would not generate this specific communication pattern.
