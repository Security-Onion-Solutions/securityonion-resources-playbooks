name: ET MALWARE X2000M.Agent Checkin Jan 24 2017
id: 22023764
description: |
  Detects X2000M.Agent malware checkin activity using a distinctive user agent string pattern.
  The specific "v7v7v7v7v7v7v7v7v7v7v7v7" user agent is unique to this malware family.
  Legitimate web browsers and applications would not use this repetitive user agent pattern.
