name: ET MALWARE MiniDuke CnC Beacon (string1_slide_2_1)
id: 22023920
description: |
  Detects MiniDuke malware command and control beacon communication using specific encoded string patterns.
  This signature identifies APT29/MiniDuke malware attempting to exfiltrate data over established C2 channels.
  May rarely trigger on legitimate applications using similar encoding patterns.
