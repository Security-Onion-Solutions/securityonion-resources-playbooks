name: ET EXPLOIT Actiontec C1000A backdoor account M2
id: 22024980
description: |
  Detects attempts to authenticate using the hardcoded backdoor account "CenturyL1nk"
  on Actiontec C1000A routers via telnet. This is a known backdoor vulnerability that
  allows unauthorized administrative access. May trigger on legitimate ISP maintenance
  but should be investigated as potential IoT compromise or lateral movement.
