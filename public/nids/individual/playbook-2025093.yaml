name: ET MALWARE UBoatRAT CnC Check-in
id: 22025093
description: |
  Detects UBoatRAT malware command and control communications based on distinctive
  binary patterns in network traffic. UBoatRAT is a remote access trojan that
  establishes persistent backdoor access and can perform data exfiltration.
  Legitimate applications would not generate this specific binary signature.
