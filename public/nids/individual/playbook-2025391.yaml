name: ET MALWARE [PTsecurity] QRat.Java.RAT (state_alive)
id: 22025391
description: |
  Detects QRat Java-based Remote Access Trojan sending "state_alive" heartbeat messages to command and control servers.
  The JSON payload containing {"state":"alive"} indicates an active malware infection maintaining persistent communication.
  The threshold requirement of 10 occurrences in 30 seconds confirms sustained malicious activity rather than isolated events.
