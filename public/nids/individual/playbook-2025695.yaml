name: ET SHELLCODE Execve(/bin/sh) Shellcode
id: 22025695
description: |
  Detects shellcode that executes /bin/sh on Linux systems via execve syscall.
  This specific byte pattern represents assembly code for spawning a shell.
  May trigger on legitimate security testing or penetration testing activities.
