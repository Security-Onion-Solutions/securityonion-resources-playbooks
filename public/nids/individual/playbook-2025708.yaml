  - question: What other file operations occurred during this SMB session?
    context: Multiple file transfers may indicate software installation or malicious toolkit deployment.
    range: -30m/+30m

      fields:
        - dst_ip
        - bytes_in
        - bytes_out

  - question: Was the DLL successfully loaded by any process on the target system?
    context: DLL loading confirms successful deployment and potential execution of malicious code.
    range: +30m

  - question: Are there signs of DLL injection or process hollowing following this transfer?
    context: Malicious DLLs often employ injection techniques to execute within legitimate processes.
    range: +1h
