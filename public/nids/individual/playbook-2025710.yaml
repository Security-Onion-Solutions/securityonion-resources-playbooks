  # Type 3: Activity Context
  - question: What other SMB activity occurred from this source around the same time?
    context: Multiple SMB requests may indicate file enumeration or bulk transfer activities.
    range: +/-15m

      fields:
        - dst_ip
        - proto
        - src_port

  - question: Was there preceding authentication activity to the target system?
    context: Successful lateral movement typically requires authentication before file transfer.
    range: -30m
    query: |
      aggregation: true
      logsource:
        category: network
        service: connection

        - proto

  # Type 4: Impact Assessment
  - question: Are there signs of process execution on the target system after file transfer?
    context: Successful lateral tool transfer is often followed by execution of the transferred files.
    range: +30m
