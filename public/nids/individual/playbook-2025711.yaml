        - proto
        - src_port

  - question: Was there preceding authentication activity to the target system via SMB2?
    context: Successful lateral movement typically requires authentication before file transfer over SMB2.
    range: -30m

      aggregation: true
      logsource:
        category: network
        service: connection

  # Type 4: Impact Assessment
  - question: Are there signs of process execution on the target system after SMB2 file transfer?
    context: Successful lateral tool transfer via SMB2 is often followed by execution of the transferred files.
