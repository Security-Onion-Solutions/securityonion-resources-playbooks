name: ET INFO WMIC WMI Request Over SMB - Likely Lateral Movement
id: 22025726
description: |
  Detects WMIC (Windows Management Instrumentation Command-line) requests transmitted over SMB protocol.
  While WMIC has legitimate administrative uses, this pattern often indicates lateral movement attempts
  by attackers using WMI for remote system reconnaissance and command execution.
