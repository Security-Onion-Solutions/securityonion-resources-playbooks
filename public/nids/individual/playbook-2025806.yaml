name: ET EXPLOIT bin bash base64 encoded Remote Code Execution 3
id: 22025806
description: |
  Detects base64 encoded bash shell commands in HTTP traffic targeting web servers.
  The pattern "vYmluL2Jhc2" decodes to "/bin/bash" indicating potential remote code execution.
  May trigger on legitimate applications that encode shell commands for processing.
