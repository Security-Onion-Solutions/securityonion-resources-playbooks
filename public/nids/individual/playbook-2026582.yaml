name: ET MALWARE JavaRAT Keep-Alive (inbound)
id: 22026582
description: |
  Detects JavaRAT malware keep-alive packets sent from command and control server to infected host.
  The "PNG_packet_" pattern maintains persistent connection for remote access capabilities.
  Legitimate applications would not use this specific packet structure for keep-alive functionality.
