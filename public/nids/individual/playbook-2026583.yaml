name: ET MALWARE JavaRAT Keep-Alive (outbound)
id: 22026583
description: |
  Detects JavaRAT malware keep-alive packets sent from infected host to command and control server.
  The "PNG_packet_" pattern indicates the malware is maintaining persistent connection for remote access.
  Legitimate applications would not use this specific packet structure for keep-alive functionality.
