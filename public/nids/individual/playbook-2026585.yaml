name: ET MALWARE JavaRAT Sending Screenshot
id: 22026585
description: |
  Detects JavaRAT malware transmitting captured screenshots to remote command and control servers.
  The malware uses a distinctive "sc.cap_sep_" separator pattern when exfiltrating screen captures.
  Legitimate screen sharing applications may rarely trigger similar patterns.
