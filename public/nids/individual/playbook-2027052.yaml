name: ET MALWARE Py/MechaFlounder CnC Activity - Reporting Upload Command Error
id: 22027052
description: |
  Detects MechaFlounder malware reporting failed upload command execution to C&C server.
  The hex pattern "2A2A75706C6F6164206661696C65642C" decodes to "**upload failed,".
  This indicates attempted data exfiltration that was unsuccessful, suggesting defensive measures may be working.
