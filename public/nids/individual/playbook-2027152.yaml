  # Type 1: Artifact Analysis
  - question: What was the complete SMTP NTLM authentication sequence captured?
    context: Understanding the authentication flow reveals the email client behavior and potential credential exposure.

  # Type 4: Impact Assessment
  - question: How much data was transmitted during this SMTP session?
    context: Large data transfers may indicate email-based data exfiltration rather than normal authentication.
    range: +2h
    query: |
