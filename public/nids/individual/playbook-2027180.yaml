name: ET INFO WMIC WMI Request Over SMB - Likely Lateral Movement (wmic.exe pattern)
id: 22027180
description: |
  Detects WMIC executable references transmitted over SMB protocol, indicating potential lateral movement.
  This rule specifically identifies the Unicode-encoded "wmic.exe" string in SMB traffic, which may indicate
  remote WMI command execution attempts or legitimate administrative activities.
