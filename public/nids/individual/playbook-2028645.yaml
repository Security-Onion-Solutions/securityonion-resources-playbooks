name: ET MALWARE Win32/Phoenix Keylogger SMTP Exfil - Logs
id: 22028645
description: |
  Detects Win32/Phoenix keylogger exfiltrating captured keystroke logs via SMTP.
  Identifies specific subject line pattern "PX | Logs | Client Name:" used for log transmission.
  Legitimate applications rarely use this exact subject format.
