questions:
  # Type 1: Artifact Analysis
  - question: What was the complete JavaScript payload containing ActiveXObject detection?
    context: Understanding the full script reveals exploit kit behavior and redirection logic.

      fields:
        - url.full
        - http.request.referrer
        - http.user_agent

  - question: What other HTTP responses occurred in the same session?
    context: Exploit kits often serve multiple payloads or redirect through multiple stages.
    range: +30m
    query: |
      aggregation: false
      logsource:
        category: network
        service: http

        - url.full
        - http.response_body.content

  # Type 4: Impact Assessment
  - question: Did the client browser follow the redirect to download malicious content?
    context: Successful exploitation requires the browser to follow the redirect and download payloads.
    range: +15m
    query: |
      aggregation: false
      logsource:
        category: network
        service: http
