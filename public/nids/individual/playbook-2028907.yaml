description: |
  Detects MSIL/Diezen malware command and control checkin communications.
  Diezen (also known as Sakabota) is a .NET-based malware that performs system reconnaissance and C2 communication.
  The specific pattern "i am here boss !" indicates malware beacon activity and is not legitimate traffic.
