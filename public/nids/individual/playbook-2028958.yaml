name: ET MALWARE Platinum APT - Titanium Payload CnC Checkin (x64)
id: 22028958
description: |
  Detects command and control communications from the x64 variant of Titanium malware used by Platinum APT.
  The x64 variant uses f=2 parameter to identify architecture. This indicates active malware infection
  on 64-bit systems and ongoing APT campaign activity. Legitimate confirm.gif access is extremely rare.
