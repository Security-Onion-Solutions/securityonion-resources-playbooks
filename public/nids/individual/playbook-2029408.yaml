name: ET MALWARE Mozart Loader Command Request (gettasks)
id: 22029408
description: |
  Detects Mozart Loader malware requesting tasks from command and control server via DNS tunneling.
  Uses threshold detection for 30+ queries in 60 seconds indicating active task polling behavior.
  May trigger on legitimate applications performing frequent DNS queries with similar patterns.
