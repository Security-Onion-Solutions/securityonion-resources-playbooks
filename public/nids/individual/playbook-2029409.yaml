name: ET MALWARE Mozart Loader Command Request (getupdates)
id: 22029409
description: |
  Detects Mozart Loader malware requesting updates from command and control server via DNS tunneling.
  Uses threshold detection for 30+ queries in 60 seconds indicating active update polling behavior.
  May trigger on legitimate software performing frequent update checks with similar DNS patterns.
