  Detects Kimsuky threat group command and control communication using specific URI patterns and user agent.
  The combination of "indox.php?v=" URI pattern with WinHttp user agent indicates Kimsuky malware activity.
  Legitimate web applications would not use this specific URI pattern with the WinHttp user agent combination.
