name: ET MALWARE ObliqueRAT CnC Heartbeat Packet
id: 22029529
description: |
  Detects ObliqueRAT command and control heartbeat packets containing the specific 4-byte signature.
  This signature (61 63 6b 00) is used by ObliqueRAT to maintain persistent communication with C2 servers.
  Legitimate applications would not send this specific byte sequence.
