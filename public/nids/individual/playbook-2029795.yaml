name: ET MALWARE Suspected CHAOS CnC Inbound (download command)
id: 22029795
description: |
  Detects CHAOS RAT command and control traffic containing base64-encoded "download" commands.
  The payload "ZG93bmxvYWQ=" decodes to "download" indicating file retrieval instructions.
  Legitimate applications rarely use this specific base64 pattern for downloads.
