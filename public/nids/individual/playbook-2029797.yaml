name: ET MALWARE Suspected CHAOS CnC Inbound (screenshot command)
id: 22029797
description: |
  Detects CHAOS RAT command and control traffic containing base64-encoded screenshot command.
  The pattern "c2NyZWVuc2hvdA==" decodes to "screenshot", indicating remote screen capture capability.
  May trigger on legitimate remote administration tools using similar encoding.
