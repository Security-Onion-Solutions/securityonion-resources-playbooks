name: ET MALWARE Suspected CHAOS CnC Inbound (keylogger start)
id: 22029798
description: |
  Detects CHAOS RAT command and control traffic containing base64-encoded keylogger start command.
  The pattern "a2V5bG9nZ2VyX3N0YXJ0" decodes to "keylogger_start", indicating keystroke capture initiation.
  May trigger on legitimate security software or monitoring tools with keylogging capabilities.
