name: ET MALWARE Suspected CHAOS CnC Inbound (getos)
id: 22029800
description: |
  Detects CHAOS RAT command and control traffic containing base64-encoded system information command.
  The pattern "Z2V0b3M=" decodes to "getos", indicating system reconnaissance and OS fingerprinting.
  May trigger on legitimate system administration or inventory tools performing OS detection.
