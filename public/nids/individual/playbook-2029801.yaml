name: ET MALWARE Suspected CHAOS CnC Inbound (openurl)
id: 22029801
description: |
  Detects CHAOS RAT command and control traffic containing base64-encoded URL opening command.
  The pattern "b3BlbnVybA==" decodes to "openurl", indicating remote browser manipulation capability.
  May trigger on legitimate remote assistance tools or automated testing frameworks that control browsers.
