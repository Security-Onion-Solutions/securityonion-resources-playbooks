name: ET EXPLOIT Multiple DrayTek Products Pre-authentication Remote RCE Outbound (CVE-2020-8515)
id: 22029806
description: |
  Detects outbound exploitation attempts targeting DrayTek router vulnerabilities (CVE-2020-8515).
  This indicates a compromised internal system attempting to exploit DrayTek devices externally.
  May trigger on legitimate administrative access to DrayTek devices, but specific parameter pattern suggests exploitation.
