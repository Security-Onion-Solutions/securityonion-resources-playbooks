name: ET HUNTING Suspicious Zipped Filename in Outbound POST Request (Prgrm.txt)
id: 22029844
description: |
  Detects outbound POST requests containing zipped files with suspicious filenames like "Prgrm.txt".
  This pattern may indicate data exfiltration attempts where program/software information is being transmitted.
  Could also be legitimate software inventory tools uploading program lists for asset management.
