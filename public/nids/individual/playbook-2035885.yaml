        - CommandLine
        - ParentImage
        - User

  - question: What other network activity occurred around the same time from this host?
    context: RAT infections often generate multiple network connections for data exfiltration and command execution.
    range: +/-15m
    query: |
      aggregation: true
      logsource:
        category: network
        service: connection
