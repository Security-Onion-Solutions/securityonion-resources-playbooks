  # Type 1: Artifact Analysis
  - question: What was the exact SIP response pattern that triggered the flood detection?
    context: Understanding the SIP response structure reveals the nature of authentication failures.
    query: |
      aggregation: false
      logsource:
        category: alert

      fields:
        - payload
        - src_ip
        - dst_ip
        - src_port
        - dst_port

  - question: What SIP methods preceded these 401 responses?
    context: Identifying the original SIP requests helps determine if this is reconnaissance or legitimate usage.

  # Type 2: Triage Assessment
  - question: Is this SIP server normally handling high authentication volumes?
    context: Legitimate SIP servers may have periods of high authentication activity during business hours.

        condition: selection
      fields:
        - dst_ip
        - connection_count

  - question: Does this align with normal VoIP usage patterns for this network?
    context: Understanding baseline SIP traffic helps distinguish attacks from legitimate high-volume periods.

  # Type 3: Activity Context
  - question: What triggered the initial SIP authentication attempts?
    context: Identifying the source of authentication requests reveals attack vectors or misconfigurations.

      fields:
        - dst_ip
        - bytes_sent
        - connection_state

  - question: Are there concurrent network scanning activities from the same sources?
    context: SIP floods often follow network reconnaissance to identify VoIP infrastructure.
