name: GPL SHELLCODE HP-UX NOOP Detection
id: 22100643
description: |
  Detects HP-UX specific NOP sled patterns commonly used in buffer overflow exploits.
  NOP sleds are sequences of no-operation instructions that provide landing zones for shellcode execution.
  May trigger on legitimate HP-UX system binaries or development tools containing similar byte patterns.
