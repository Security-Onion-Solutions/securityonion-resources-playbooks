name: GPL SHELLCODE SPARC NOOP Detection
id: 22100644
description: |
  Detects SPARC architecture specific NOP sled patterns used in buffer overflow exploits.
  SPARC NOP sleds provide instruction landing zones for shellcode execution on Sun/Oracle systems.
  May trigger on legitimate SPARC binaries or development environments containing similar opcodes.
