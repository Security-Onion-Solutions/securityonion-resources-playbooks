name: GPL SHELLCODE SPARC NOOP Alternative Pattern Detection
id: 22100645
description: |
  Detects alternative SPARC architecture NOP sled patterns used in buffer overflow exploits.
  This variant uses different SPARC opcodes for NOP operations in shellcode payloads.
  May trigger on legitimate SPARC system binaries or compiler-generated code with similar patterns.
