name: GPL SHELLCODE SPARC NOOP Third Variant Detection
id: 22100646
description: |
  Detects another variant of SPARC architecture NOP sled patterns used in buffer overflow exploits.
  This pattern represents a different encoding of SPARC no-operation instructions in shellcode.
  May trigger on legitimate SPARC binaries, system libraries, or development tools with similar byte sequences.
