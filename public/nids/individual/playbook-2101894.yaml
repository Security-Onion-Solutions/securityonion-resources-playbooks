name: GPL EXPLOIT kadmind buffer overflow attempt
id: 22101894
description: |
  Detects buffer overflow exploitation attempts against kadmind (Kerberos administration daemon)
  on port 749. This targets CVE-2002-1226/1235 vulnerabilities that allow remote code execution.
  Legitimate kadmind administration should not contain these specific byte patterns.
