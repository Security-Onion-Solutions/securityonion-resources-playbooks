name: GPL EXPLOIT kadmind buffer overflow attempt
id: 22101897
description: |
  Detects buffer overflow exploitation attempts against kadmind using KADM protocol headers
  on port 751. This targets CVE-2002-1226/1235 vulnerabilities with specific KADM0.0A
  protocol exploitation patterns that allow remote code execution on alternate port.
