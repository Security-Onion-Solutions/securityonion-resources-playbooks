id: 22101913
description: |
  Detects format string exploitation attempts against RPC statd service via UDP.

  # Type 1: Artifact Analysis
  - question: What was the exact RPC statd payload structure and format string pattern?
    context: Understanding the RPC call structure reveals exploitation technique and payload characteristics.

        - payload
        - payload_printable
        - alert.signature

  - question: What UDP port was targeted for the RPC statd service?
    context: RPC statd typically runs on port 111 or dynamically assigned ports, identifying the exact service.
