name: GPL RPC STATD UDP monitor mon_name format string exploit attempt
id: 22101915
description: |
  Detects format string exploitation attempts against RPC statd monitor service via UDP.
  This targets CVE-2000-0666 in the monitor mon_name function which can lead to remote code execution.
  May trigger on legitimate RPC statd monitor communications with unusual formatting.
