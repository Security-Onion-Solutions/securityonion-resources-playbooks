name: GPL RPC portmap Network Status Monitor Request UDP

description: |
  Detects RPC portmap requests for Network Status Monitor (NSM) service enumeration.
  This may indicate reconnaissance for Unix/Linux systems or legitimate system monitoring.
  NSM service discovery often precedes targeted attacks on RPC services.
