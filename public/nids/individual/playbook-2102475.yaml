name: GPL NETBIOS SMB-DS ADMIN$ Unicode Share Access
id: 22102475
description: |
  Detects Unicode-encoded access attempts to the Windows ADMIN$ administrative share via SMB.
  May indicate legitimate administrative activity or potential evasion attempts using Unicode encoding.
  Unicode encoding can be used to bypass basic string-based detection mechanisms.
