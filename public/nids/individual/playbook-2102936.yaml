name: GPL NETBIOS SMB NDdeSetTrustedShareW overflow attempt
id: 22102936
description: |
  Detects buffer overflow attempts targeting the NDdeSetTrustedShareW function in SMB/NetBIOS services.
  This exploits CVE-2004-0206 to potentially execute arbitrary code with administrative privileges.
  May trigger on legitimate DDE operations but typically indicates malicious exploitation attempts.
