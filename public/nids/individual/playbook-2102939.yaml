name: GPL NETBIOS SMB-DS NDdeSetTrustedShareW Unicode Buffer Overflow Attempt
id: 22102939
description: |
  Detects unicode variant buffer overflow exploitation targeting CVE-2004-0206 in Windows NetDDE service.
  The NDdeSetTrustedShareW function is vulnerable to buffer overflow via unicode-encoded SMB requests.
  May trigger on legitimate unicode NetDDE operations but oversized unicode buffers indicate exploitation.
