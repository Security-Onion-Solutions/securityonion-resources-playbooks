name: GPL NETBIOS SMB InitiateSystemShutdown Unicode Attempt
id: 22102944
description: |
  Detects unicode-encoded attempts to remotely shutdown Windows systems via SMB InitiateSystemShutdown RPC calls.
  Unicode encoding may indicate international character support or obfuscation techniques.
  Legitimate administrative tools supporting internationalization may generate unicode-encoded commands.
