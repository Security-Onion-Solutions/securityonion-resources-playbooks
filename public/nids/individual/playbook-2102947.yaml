name: GPL NETBIOS SMB NDdeSetTrustedShareW unicode little endian overflow attempt
id: 22102947
description: |
  Detects unicode little endian buffer overflow attempts targeting NDdeSetTrustedShareW in SMB services.
  This variant of CVE-2004-0206 uses unicode encoding to bypass basic string filters.
  Legitimate unicode SMB operations are rare, making this highly suspicious for exploitation attempts.
