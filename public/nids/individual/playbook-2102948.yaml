name: GPL NETBIOS SMB-DS NDdeSetTrustedShareW Little Endian Buffer Overflow Attempt
id: 22102948
description: |
  Detects buffer overflow exploitation attempts targeting CVE-2004-0206 in Windows NetDDE service.
  The NDdeSetTrustedShareW function is vulnerable to buffer overflow via crafted SMB requests.
  May trigger on legitimate NetDDE operations but oversized buffers indicate exploitation attempts.
