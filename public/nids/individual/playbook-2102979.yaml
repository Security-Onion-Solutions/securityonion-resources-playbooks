name: GPL NETBIOS SMB-DS C$ unicode andx share access
id: 22102979
description: |
  Detects attempts to access the C$ administrative share using Unicode encoding via SMB over port 445.
  C$ provides direct access to the system drive root and is commonly targeted for lateral movement.
  Unicode encoding may indicate evasion attempts or specific exploitation tools.
