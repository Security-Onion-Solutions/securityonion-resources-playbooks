name: GPL NETBIOS SMB-DS Session Setup NTMLSSP unicode asn1 overflow attempt
id: 22103003
description: |
  Detects Unicode variant attempts to exploit CVE-2003-0818 ASN.1 buffer overflow in SMB.
  This targets Unicode-enabled SMB sessions for remote code execution.
  Legitimate Unicode SMB traffic should not contain malformed ASN.1 structures.
