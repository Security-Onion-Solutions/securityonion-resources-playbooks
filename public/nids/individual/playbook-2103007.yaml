name: GPL IMAP delete overflow attempt
id: 22103007
description: |
  Detects potential buffer overflow attempts targeting IMAP DELETE command.
  Triggers when DELETE command is followed by excessive data (>100 bytes).
  May indicate exploitation attempt against vulnerable IMAP servers or legitimate clients with extremely long mailbox names.

questions:
  - question: What was the exact DELETE command and mailbox name specification?
    context: Understanding the complete DELETE syntax reveals if this is legitimate mailbox deletion or exploitation attempt.

  - question: Has the IMAP server experienced service disruption or crashes after this attempt?
    context: Successful buffer overflow exploitation may cause service instability or complete server compromise.
