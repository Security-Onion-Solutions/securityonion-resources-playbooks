name: GPL NETBIOS SMB NT Trans NT CREATE unicode oversized Security Descriptor attempt
id: 22103020
description: |
  Detects unicode-encoded oversized security descriptors in SMB NT CREATE transactions.
  This unicode variant of CVE-2004-1154 uses character encoding to evade basic detection mechanisms.
