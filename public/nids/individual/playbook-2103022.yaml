name: GPL NETBIOS SMB-DS NT Trans NT CREATE Oversized Security Descriptor Attempt
id: 22103022
description: |
  Detects potential exploitation attempts against CVE-2004-1154, targeting oversized security descriptors in SMB-DS NT transactions.
  This vulnerability allows buffer overflow attacks through malformed NT CREATE requests with excessive security descriptor sizes.
  May trigger on legitimate applications creating files with large security descriptors.
