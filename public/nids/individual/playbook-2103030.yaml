name: GPL NETBIOS SMB-DS NT Trans NT CREATE SACL overflow attempt
id: 22103030
description: |
  Detects potential buffer overflow attempts targeting SMB NT CREATE operations via SACL manipulation.
  This targets CVE-2004-1154, exploiting Windows SMB service security descriptor handling for remote code execution.
  May trigger on legitimate but malformed SMB traffic or security auditing tools.
