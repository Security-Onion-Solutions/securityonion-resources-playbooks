name: GPL NETBIOS SMB-DS NT Trans NT CREATE DACL overflow attempt
id: 22103038
description: |
  Detects potential buffer overflow attempts targeting SMB NT CREATE operations via DACL manipulation.
  This targets CVE-2004-1154, a critical vulnerability in Windows SMB service that allows remote code execution.
  May trigger on legitimate but malformed SMB traffic or network scanning tools.
