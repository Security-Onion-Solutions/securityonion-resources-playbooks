name: GPL NETBIOS SMB-DS NT Trans NT CREATE unicode DACL overflow attempt
id: 22103040
description: |
  Detects potential buffer overflow attempts targeting SMB NT CREATE operations via Unicode DACL manipulation.
  This targets CVE-2004-1154 using Unicode encoding to bypass security checks in Windows SMB service.
  May trigger on legitimate Unicode-enabled SMB traffic or internationalized applications.
