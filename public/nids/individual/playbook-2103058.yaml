name: GPL IMAP copy literal overflow attempt
id: 22103058
description: |
  Detects potential buffer overflow attempts targeting IMAP COPY command with literal strings.
  Triggers when COPY command contains literal size specification >1024 bytes.
  May indicate exploitation attempt against vulnerable IMAP servers or legitimate clients copying large message sets.

questions:
  - question: What was the exact COPY command structure and literal size specification?
    context: Understanding the literal size and mailbox names reveals if this is legitimate message copying or exploitation.

  - question: What is the source and destination mailbox specification in the COPY command?
    context: Unusual mailbox names or paths may indicate directory traversal or exploitation attempts.

  - question: Has the IMAP server shown signs of memory exhaustion or service degradation?
    context: Large literal processing may cause memory consumption issues or buffer overflow exploitation.

  - question: Are there signs of successful COPY completion or session continuation?
    context: Normal COPY operations would show continued session activity and proper IMAP response codes.
