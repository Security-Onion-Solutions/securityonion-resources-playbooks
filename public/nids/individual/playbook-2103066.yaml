name: GPL IMAP append overflow attempt
id: 22103066
description: |
  Detects potential buffer overflow attempts targeting IMAP APPEND command.
  Triggers when APPEND command is followed by excessive data (>256 bytes).
  May indicate exploitation attempt against vulnerable IMAP servers or legitimate clients appending large messages.

questions:
  - question: What was the exact APPEND command structure and message size specified?
    context: Understanding the complete APPEND syntax reveals if this is legitimate message upload or exploitation.
