name: GPL IMAP examine overflow attempt
id: 22103068
description: |
  Detects potential buffer overflow attempts targeting IMAP EXAMINE command.
  Triggers when EXAMINE command is followed by excessive data (>100 bytes).
  May indicate exploitation attempt against vulnerable IMAP servers or legitimate clients with large mailbox names.

questions:
  - question: What was the exact EXAMINE command and payload sent to the IMAP server?
    context: Understanding the complete command structure reveals if this is a legitimate mailbox access or exploitation attempt.
