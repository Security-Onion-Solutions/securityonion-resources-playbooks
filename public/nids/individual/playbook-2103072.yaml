name: GPL IMAP status overflow attempt
id: 22103072
description: |
  Detects potential buffer overflow attempts against IMAP servers via excessively long STATUS commands, including CVE-2005-1256.
  May trigger on legitimate IMAP clients with very long mailbox names, but typically indicates exploitation attempts targeting IMAP STATUS command parsing vulnerabilities.
