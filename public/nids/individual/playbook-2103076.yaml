name: GPL IMAP unsubscribe overflow attempt
id: 22103076
description: |

        - bytes_toclient
        - duration

  - question: Was there successful authentication before this overflow attempt?
    context: Successful authentication followed by overflow attempts suggests compromised credentials or insider threat.
