name: GPL NETBIOS SMB-DS llsrconnect unicode little endian overflow attempt
id: 22103125
description: |
  Detects buffer overflow attempts targeting the Windows LLS (License Logging Service) RPC interface via SMB.
  This targets CVE-2005-0050 affecting Windows 2000/XP/2003. Legitimate license service connections should not contain oversized buffers.
