name: GPL NETBIOS SMB-DS llsrconnect Little Endian AndX Overflow Attempt
id: 22103127
description: |
  Detects potential buffer overflow attempts targeting the llsrconnect interface using little endian encoding.
  This targets MS05-010 vulnerability in the License Logging Service with specific byte ordering.
  May trigger on legitimate license logging service calls but unusual from external sources.
