name: GPL NETBIOS SMB CoGetInstanceFromFile Unicode Overflow Attempt
id: 22103178
description: |
  Detects potential buffer overflow attempts targeting CVE-2003-0995 in Windows SMB service.
  This vulnerability allows remote code execution through malformed CoGetInstanceFromFile requests.
  May trigger on legitimate SMB traffic with similar patterns but overflow conditions indicate attack.
