name: GPL NETBIOS SMB-DS CoGetInstanceFromFile unicode andx overflow attempt
id: 22103190
description: |
  Detects buffer overflow attempts in SMB-DS CoGetInstanceFromFile operations using unicode encoding.
  References CVE-2003-0995, a critical Windows DCOM vulnerability allowing remote code execution.
  May trigger on legitimate DCOM operations but overflow patterns indicate exploitation attempts.
