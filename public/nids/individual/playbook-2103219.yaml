name: GPL NETBIOS SMB OpenKey little endian overflow attempt
id: 22103219
description: |
  Detects potential buffer overflow attempts targeting SMB OpenKey functionality using little endian encoding.
  This targets CVE-2000-0377, a vulnerability in Windows registry access via SMB.
  May trigger on legitimate registry operations with large key names or malformed SMB traffic.
