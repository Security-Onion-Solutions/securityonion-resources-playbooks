name: GPL NETBIOS SMB OpenKey unicode little endian overflow attempt
id: 22103221
description: |
  Detects potential buffer overflow attempts targeting SMB OpenKey functionality using unicode encoding with little endian byte order.
  This targets CVE-2000-0377, a vulnerability in Windows registry access via SMB.
  May trigger on legitimate registry operations with unicode key names or malformed SMB traffic.
