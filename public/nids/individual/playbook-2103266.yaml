name: GPL NETBIOS SMB-DS IrotIsRunning Unicode Exploitation Attempt
id: 22103266
description: |
  Detects attempts to exploit CVE-2002-1561 via SMB-DS IrotIsRunning function with unicode encoding.
  This vulnerability allows buffer overflow in Windows RPC interface. May trigger on legitimate
  DCOM operations but unusual unicode patterns suggest exploitation attempts.
