name: GPL NETBIOS SMB-DS IrotIsRunning Unicode Little Endian Exploitation Attempt
id: 22103267
description: |
  Detects little endian variant of CVE-2002-1561 exploitation via SMB-DS IrotIsRunning function.
  This buffer overflow vulnerability targets Windows RPC interface with specific byte ordering.
  May trigger on legitimate DCOM operations but little endian encoding suggests targeted exploitation.
