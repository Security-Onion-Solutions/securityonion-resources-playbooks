id: 22103269
description: |
  Detects potential exploitation attempts targeting CVE-2002-1561 via SMB-DS IrotIsRunning interface.
  This vulnerability affects Windows RPC services and can lead to buffer overflow conditions.
  May trigger on legitimate DCOM/RPC operations but unusual for external connections.
