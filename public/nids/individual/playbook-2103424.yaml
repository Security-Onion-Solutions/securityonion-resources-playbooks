name: GPL NETBIOS SMB-DS RemoteActivation Unicode Little Endian AndX Attempt
id: 22103424
description: |
  Detects potential SMB-DS RemoteActivation exploitation attempts using unicode little endian encoding.
  This targets DCE/RPC RemoteActivation interface which can be used for remote code execution.
  May trigger on legitimate DCOM RemoteActivation calls but unusual from external sources.
