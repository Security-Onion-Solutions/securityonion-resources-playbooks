name: GPL NETBIOS SMB-DS CoGetInstanceFromFile unicode attempt
id: 22103435
description: |
  Detects potential DCOM exploitation attempts using unicode encoding via SMB.
  This pattern indicates attempts to bypass security controls through character encoding.
  May trigger on legitimate unicode-based DCOM operations but suspicious from external sources.
