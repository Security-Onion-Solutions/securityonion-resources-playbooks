name: GPL NETBIOS SMB-DS CoGetInstanceFromFile unicode little endian attempt
id: 22103436
description: |
  Detects potential DCOM exploitation attempts using unicode encoding with little endian byte ordering via SMB.
  This specific encoding combination may indicate advanced evasion techniques or platform-specific targeting.
  May trigger on legitimate unicode DCOM operations but highly suspicious from external sources.
