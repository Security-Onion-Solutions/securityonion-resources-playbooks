questions:
- question: What file creation event triggered this alert?
  context: |
    Review the filename, location, and extension to help confirm the legitimacy of the file creation.
  answer_sources:
  - alert

      selection:
        document_id|expand: '%document_id%'
      condition: selection
    fields:
      - hostname
      - User
      - file.path
- question: What process created this file?
  context: |
    Reviewing the process and command line provides additional context. Pivoting off the ProcessGuid
    will show the full process chain leading to the file creation.

- question: Is the file location and type expected for the executable?
  context: |
    Certain executables should only write to specific directories. Unusual locations can indicate malicious activity. This query
    shows the historical pattern of file creation by this executable on this system.

- question: What is the historical pattern of file creation by this executable?
  context: |
    Understanding normal file creation patterns helps identify anomalous behavior.

- question: What other files were created by this process in the same timeframe?
  context: |
    Multiple file creations can reveal patterns like data staging, malware installation, or batch operations.

- question: Were any processes spawned from the created file location?
  context: |
    Execution from newly created files can indicate malware drops or persistence mechanisms.
