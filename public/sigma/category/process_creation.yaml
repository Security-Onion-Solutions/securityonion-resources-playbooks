  Baseline Playbook for process creation events, OS agnostic. This playbook helps analysts investigate
  any suspicious process execution by examining context, legitimacy, impact, and threat indicators.
  Process creation alerts can range from legitimate administrative tools to known malware execution.

questions:

  - question: What was the exact process execution that triggered the alert?
    context: |
      Examine the full context of the alert including command line arguments, parent process,
      and user context to understand what triggered this detection.
    answer_sources:
      - alert
    query: |
      aggregation: false
      logsource:
        category: alert
      detection:
        selection:
          document_id|expand: '%document_id%'
        condition: selection
      fields:
        - User
        - ParentImage
        - Image
        - CommandLine

  - question: Is this normal activity for this user and system?
    context: |
      Check if this user typically runs this process on this system. Historical patterns
      help distinguish between legitimate administrative work and anomalous behavior.

      aggregation: false

        selection:
          hostname|expand: '%hostname%'

        condition: selection
      fields:
        - User
        - CommandLine
        - event.action

  - question: What is the process execution chain around this event?
    context: |
      Examine parent process activity, sibling processes, and child processes to understand
      the complete execution flow.
    range: +/-15m

      aggregation: false
      logsource:
        category: process_creation

      fields:
        - User
        - CurrentDirectory
        - Image
        - CommandLine

  - question: What other processes on this system did this user execute recently?
    context: |
      Understanding the user's recent activity helps establish intent and identify
      suspicious behavior or legitimate workflows.
    range: +/-10m
    answer_sources:
      - process_creation
    query: |
      aggregation: true
      logsource:
        category: process_creation
      detection:
        selection:
          hostname|expand: '%hostname%'
          User|expand: '%User%'
        condition: selection
      fields:
        - Image
        - CommandLine

  - question: What files did this process create or modify?
    context: |
      File creation and modification patterns reveal the process's actual behavior and potential impact.
      Look for sensitive data access, configuration changes, or payload drops. The query looks for file events
      associated with both the process and its parent.
    range: +/-15m
    answer_sources:
      - file_event
    query: |
      aggregation: true
      logsource:
        category: file_event
      detection:
        selection:
          - ProcessGuid|expand: '%ProcessGuid%'
          - ParentProcessGuid|expand: '%ParentProcessGuid%'
        condition: selection
      fields:
        - EventType
        - Image
        - TargetFilename

  - question: What network connections did this process make?
    context: |
      Network activity can reveal command and control, data exfiltration, or lateral
      movement attempts. Pivoting on the Community ID can further identify related network events.
    range: +/-15m
    answer_sources:
      - network_connection
    query: |
      aggregation: true
      logsource:
        category: network_connection
      detection:
        selection:
          ProcessGuid|expand: '%ProcessGuid%'
        condition: selection
      fields:
        - source.ip
        - source.port
        - destination.ip
        - destination.port
        - network.initiated
        - community_id

  - question: What registry changes did this process make?
    context: |
      On Windows systems, registry activity can reveal further intent. 
      The query looks for registry changes made by the process and its parent.
    range: +/-15m
    answer_sources:
      - registry_event
    query: |
      aggregation: true
      logsource:
        category: registry_event
      detection:
        selection:
          ProcessGuid|expand: '%ProcessGuid%'
          ParentProcessGuid|expand: '%ParentProcessGuid%'
        condition: selection
      fields:
        - EventType
        - TargetRegistryKey
        - TargetRegistryValueName
        - TargetRegistryValueType

  - question: Is similar activity occurring across the organization?
    context: |
      Search for the same command patterns on other systems to determine if this is
      isolated or part of a broader attack. Check both recent and historical timeframes.
