name: Security Onion IDH - NTP Request
id: 1500013
description: |
    Detects when attempts are made to interact with the IDH NTP service. This indicates potential malicious activity targeting NTP services, which could be used for reconnaissance or amplification attacks. Review the source IP and NTP commands for context.
