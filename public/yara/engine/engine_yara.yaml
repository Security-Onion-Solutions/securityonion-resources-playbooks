questions:
  - question: What specifically does the YARA rule detect?
    context: Review the YARA rule name and description to understand what patterns or behaviors the rule is designed to identify.
    answer_sources:
      - alert
    query: |
      aggregation: false
      logsource:
        category: alert
      detection:
        selection:
          document_id|expand: '%document_id%'
        condition: selection
      fields:
        - rule.name
        - rule.description
        - scan.yara.matches
        - file.name

  - question: What file triggered the YARA alert and what are its characteristics?
    context: Understanding the file type, location, and hash values helps assess the risk and determine if this is legitimate software or malware.
    query: |
      aggregation: false
      logsource:
        category: alert
      detection:
        selection:
          document_id|expand: '%document_id%'
        condition: selection
      fields:
        - file.name
        - file.size
        - file.mime_type
        - scan.pe.file_info.file_description
        - scan.pe.file_info.company_name

  - question: Has this file hash been seen before on this or other hosts?
    context: Files with the same hash on multiple systems may indicate lateral movement, legitimate software deployment, or widespread infection.
    range: -30d
    query: |
      aggregation: true
      logsource:
        category: process_creation
      detection:
        selection:
          process.hash.sha256|expand: '%hash.sha256%'
        condition: selection
      fields:
        - hostname
        - User
        - Image
        - CommandLine

  - question: What are the PE file details and imported functions?
    context: Analyzing PE headers, imports, and exports can reveal malware capabilities and help identify packed or obfuscated files.
    query: |
      aggregation: false
      logsource:
        category: alert
      detection:
        selection:
          document_id|expand: '%document_id%'
        condition: selection
      fields:
        - scan.pe.imphash
        - scan.pe.compile_time
        - scan.pe.file_info.original_filename
        - scan.pe.symbols.imported
        - scan.pe.dll_characteristics
        - scan.pe.sections


  - question: What digital signatures or certificates are associated with this file?
    context: Valid signatures from known vendors suggest legitimate software, while invalid or suspicious signatures may indicate tampering.
    query: |
      aggregation: false
      logsource:
        category: alert
      detection:
        selection:
          document_id|expand: '%document_id%'
        condition: selection
      fields:
        - scan.pe.flags
        - scan.pe.file_info.company_name
        - scan.pe.file_info.product_name
        - scan.pe.file_info.legal_copyright

  - question: What are the entropy values and section characteristics of the file?
    context: High entropy sections may indicate packed or encrypted malware, while section names and characteristics reveal file structure.
    query: |
      aggregation: false
      logsource:
        category: alert
      detection:
        selection:
          document_id|expand: '%document_id%'
        condition: selection
      fields:
        - scan.entropy.entropy
        - scan.pe.sections
