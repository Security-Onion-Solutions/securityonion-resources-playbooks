name: ET SCAN Behavioral Unusual Port 445 traffic Potential Scan or Infection
id: 1257119
description: |
  Detects unusually high volume of SMB connection attempts on port 445, which may indicate scanning activity or malware attempting to spread laterally.
  May trigger on legitimate enterprise file sharing, domain authentication, or system administration tasks.
