name: ET INFO Proxy HEAD Request
id: 1257604
description: |
  Detects HTTP HEAD requests with proxy syntax (absolute URLs) which may indicate proxy usage or tunneling activity.
  Can be legitimate proxy traffic or automated tools, but may also indicate unauthorized proxy usage or C2 communications.
