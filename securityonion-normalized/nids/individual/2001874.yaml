name: ET EXPLOIT TCP Reset from MS Exchange after chunked data, probably crashed it (MS05-021)
id: 1244573
description: |
  Detects TCP reset packets from SMTP servers after chunked data transfer, indicating potential MS Exchange crash from MS05-021 exploitation.
  May trigger on legitimate network issues, connection timeouts, or normal SMTP session terminations.
