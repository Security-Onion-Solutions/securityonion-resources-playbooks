name: ET USER_AGENTS Suspicious User Agent (agent)
id: 1211398
description: |
  Detects HTTP requests using the generic "agent" user-agent string, which is commonly used by malware, automated tools, and custom scripts.
  May also trigger on legitimate automation tools, scripts, or applications using minimal user-agent strings.
