name: ET INFO SSHv2 Client KEX Detected on Expected Port
id: 1257717
description: |
  Detects SSH client key exchange packets on standard SSH ports indicating normal SSH protocol negotiation.
  This is expected behavior for legitimate SSH connections but may also indicate SSH-based lateral movement or remote access.
