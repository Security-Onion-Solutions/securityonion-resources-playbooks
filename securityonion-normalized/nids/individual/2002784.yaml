name: ET EXPLOIT Java private function call sun.misc.unsafe
id: 1245076
description: |
  Detects Java bytecode containing references to sun.misc.Unsafe, a restricted class that provides low-level system access.
  May trigger on legitimate applications using reflection or advanced Java libraries, but commonly indicates malicious code execution.
