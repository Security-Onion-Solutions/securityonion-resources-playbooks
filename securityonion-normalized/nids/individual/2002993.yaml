name: ET SCAN Rapid POP3S Connections - Possible Brute Force Attack
id: 1200288
description: |
  Detects rapid connection attempts to POP3S service (port 995) that may indicate brute force attacks.
  May trigger on legitimate email clients with aggressive retry logic or large email synchronization operations.

        - src_ip
        - dst_ip
        - dst_port
  - question: Does this source IP normally connect to POP3S services in this environment?
    context: Determines if these connections represent a deviation from normal email access patterns.

  - question: What other services is this source IP attempting to connect to?
    context: Identifies if this is part of broader network reconnaissance or service enumeration.
    range: +/-2h

  - question: Are other external IPs attempting rapid connections to POP3S services?
    context: Determines if multiple sources are targeting POP3S infrastructure simultaneously.
    range: +/-4h

  - question: Are there authentication logs corresponding to these POP3S connection attempts?
    context: Correlates network connections with authentication events to identify brute force patterns.
    range: +/-30m
    query: "aggregation: false\nlogsource:\n  category: authentication\ndetection:\n  selection:\n    source.ip: '{source.ip}'\n    event.outcome:\n      - failure\n      - success\n  condition: selection\nfields:\n  - event.outcome\n  - user.name\n  - source.ip\n  - service.name\n  \n"
