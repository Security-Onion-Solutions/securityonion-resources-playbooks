name: ET INFO Unusual number of DNS No Such Name Responses
id: 1257423
description: |
  Detects hosts receiving many DNS NXDOMAIN responses, which may indicate malware attempting to contact multiple non-existent domains, DGA activity, or DNS tunneling attempts.
  Can also trigger on misconfigured applications or legitimate software with outdated domain lists.
