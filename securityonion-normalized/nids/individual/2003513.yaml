name: ET HUNTING Suspicious Mozilla User-Agent typo (MOzilla/4.0)
id: 1248152
description: |
  Detects HTTP requests with a suspicious Mozilla User-Agent containing a typo (MOzilla/4.0 instead of Mozilla/4.0).
  This pattern is associated with certain malware families attempting to mimic legitimate browsers but may also occur due to software bugs or custom applications.
