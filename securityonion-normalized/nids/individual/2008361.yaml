name: ET USER_AGENTS Suspicious User-Agent (Accessing)
id: 1225975
description: |
  Detects HTTP requests using the exact user-agent string "Accessing" which is associated with malware communications.
  This specific user-agent is rarely used by legitimate applications and often indicates C2 traffic or malware beaconing.
