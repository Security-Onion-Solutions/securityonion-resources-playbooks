name: ET MALWARE FakeAV Win32/Antivirus2008 CnC Beacon
id: 1241876
description: |
  Detects HTTP requests with specific URI parameters (nick=, group=, os=) and Mozilla user-agent matching Win32/Antivirus2008 FakeAV command-and-control beacon patterns.
  May trigger on legitimate applications using similar parameter structures or browsers with standard Mozilla user-agents.
