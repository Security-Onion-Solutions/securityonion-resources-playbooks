name: ET HUNTING Suspicious User-Agent (NULL)
id: 1217712
description: |
  Detects HTTP requests with "NULL" user-agent string, which may indicate automated tools, malware, or custom scripts.
  May also trigger on legitimate applications with non-standard user-agent configurations or testing tools.
