name: ET USER_AGENTS Suspicious User-Agent (winlogon)
id: 1228200
description: |
  Detects HTTP requests using "winlogon" as the user-agent string.
  Legitimate Windows components typically do not make HTTP requests with this user-agent, though some system tools or custom applications might use it legitimately.
