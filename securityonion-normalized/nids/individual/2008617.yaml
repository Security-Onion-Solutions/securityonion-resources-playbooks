      fields:
        - dst_ip
  - question: What other URIs were requested by this source IP during the scanning session?
    context: Identifies the scope and pattern of the Wikto scanning activity.

  - question: What was the web server's response to the non-existent URI request?
    context: Analyzes how the target server handled the scanning probe.
