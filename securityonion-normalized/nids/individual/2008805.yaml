name: ET MALWARE DNS Changer.bnm/Downloader.bnm CnC Channel Start
id: 1253038
description: |
  Detects the initial 8-byte handshake sequence used by DNS Changer.bnm and Downloader.bnm malware families to establish command and control communication channels.
  This specific byte pattern indicates the start of malware C2 communication rather than legitimate application traffic.
