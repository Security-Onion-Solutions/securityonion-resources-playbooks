name: ET SHELLCODE Lichtenfels Shellcode (UDP)
id: 1242461
description: |
  Detects UDP traffic containing the Lichtenfels shellcode pattern, which may indicate exploitation attempts or malware payload delivery.
  Could trigger on legitimate network traffic with similar byte patterns or network security testing tools.
