questions:
  - question: What was the complete HTTP request that resulted in the 401 response?
    context: Reveals the specific resource being accessed and authentication method attempted.
    range: +/-15m
    query: |
      aggregation: false
      logsource:
        category: network
        service: http

          community_id: '{network.community_id}'
        condition: selection
      fields:
        - http.method
        - http.useragent
        - http.virtual_host
        - http.uri
        - http.status_code
  - question: Does this client normally access this web server?
    context: Determines if this represents unusual access patterns or legitimate user activity.
    range: -7d

      aggregation: true
      logsource:
        category: network

          dst_ip: '{destination.ip}'
        condition: selection
      fields:
        - dst_ip
  - question: What is the pattern of 401 responses from this server?
    context: Identifies if multiple authentication failures are occurring in sequence.
    range: +/-30m
    query: "aggregation: false\nlogsource:\n  category: network\n  service: http\ndetection:\n  selection:\n    src_ip: '{source.ip}'\n    http.status_code: 401\n  condition: selection\nfields:\n  - dst_ip\n  - dst_port\n  - http.uri\n  - http.user_agent\n  - http.method\n  \n"
  - question: What other HTTP responses did this server send to the same client?
    context: Provides context about the overall interaction between client and server.
    range: +/-15m
    query: "aggregation: false\nlogsource:\n  category: network\n  service: http\ndetection:\n  selection:\n    src_ip: '{source.ip}'\n    dst_ip: '{destination.ip}'\n  condition: selection\nfields:\n  - http.status_code\n  - http.uri\n  - http.method\n  - http.user_agent\n  \n"
  - question: Are multiple clients receiving 401 responses from this server?
    context: Determines if this is isolated authentication failure or broader access control issue.
    range: +/-30m
    query: "aggregation: false\nlogsource:\n  category: network\n  service: http\ndetection:\n  selection:\n    dst_ip: '{destination.ip}'\n    http.status_code: 401\n  condition: selection\nfields:\n  - src_ip\n  - http.uri\n  - http.user_agent\n  - http.method\n  \n"
  - question: What other external connections occurred from this client?
    context: Identifies if the client is attempting to access other services or resources.
    range: +/-10m

  - question: Did this client attempt to access common administrative or sensitive paths?
    context: Reveals if authentication failures involve privileged resource access attempts.
    range: +/-1h
    query: "aggregation: false\nlogsource:\n  category: network\n  service: http\ndetection:\n  selection:\n    src_ip: '{source.ip}'\n    http.uri|contains:\n      - admin\n      - login\n      - wp-admin\n      - phpmyadmin\n      - manager\n      - console\n      - api\n      - auth\n  condition: selection\nfields:\n  - dst_ip\n  - http.uri\n  - http.status_code\n  - http.method\n  - http.user_agent\n  \n"
  - question: Are there related authentication alerts involving the same client or server?
    context: Identifies coordinated authentication attempts or broader security events.
