name: ET ADWARE_PUP W3i Related Adware/Spyware
id: 1228819
description: |
  Detects HTTP GET requests containing multiple parameters (shortname, os, v, browsers, readable) that match W3i adware communication patterns.
  May trigger on legitimate software inventory tools or system monitoring applications that collect similar information.
