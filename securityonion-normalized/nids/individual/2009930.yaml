name: ET ADWARE_PUP User-Agent (User Agent) - Likely Hostile
id: 1211023
description: |
  Detects HTTP requests with "User Agent" as the user-agent string, which is often used by adware, PUP software, or automated tools.
  May trigger on legitimate software with poorly configured HTTP clients or testing tools.
