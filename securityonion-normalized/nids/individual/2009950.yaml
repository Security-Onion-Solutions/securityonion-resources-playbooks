name: ET WEB_SERVER Tilde in URI - potential .inc source disclosure vulnerability
id: 1222245
description: |
  Detects HTTP requests containing tilde characters in URIs targeting .inc files, which may indicate attempts to access backup or temporary files created by web servers or editors. Could represent legitimate file access or reconnaissance for source code disclosure.
