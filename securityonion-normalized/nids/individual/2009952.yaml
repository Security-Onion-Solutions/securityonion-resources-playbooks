name: ET WEB_SERVER Tilde in URI - potential .asp source disclosure vulnerability
id: 1222246
description: |
  Detects HTTP requests containing tilde characters in ASP file URIs, which may indicate attempts to access source code through filename enumeration techniques.
  May trigger on legitimate requests to files with tilde characters or automated security scanning tools.

questions:
  - question: What was the complete URI containing the tilde character in the ASP request?
    context: Reveals the specific filename enumeration pattern being attempted.
