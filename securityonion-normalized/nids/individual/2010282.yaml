name: ET MALWARE Generic Trojan Checkin (double Content-Type headers)
id: 1253991
description: |
  Detects HTTP POST requests to PHP endpoints with duplicate Content-Type headers, a technique used by trojans to disguise C2 traffic.
  May trigger on legitimate applications with malformed headers or specific PHP frameworks with unusual header handling.
