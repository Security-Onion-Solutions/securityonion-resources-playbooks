name: ET DOS Possible Cisco PIX/ASA Denial Of Service Attempt (Hping Created Packets)
id: 1245708
description: |
  Detects packets with specific byte patterns that may indicate attempts to exploit CVE-2009-1157 against Cisco PIX/ASA devices.
  May trigger on legitimate network testing tools or fragmented legitimate traffic with similar patterns.
