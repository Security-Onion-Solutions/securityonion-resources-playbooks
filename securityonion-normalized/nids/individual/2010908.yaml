description: "Detects inbound HTTP requests with an exact \"Mozilla/5.0\" user-agent string, which may indicate \nautomated tools, malware, or scripts using minimal browser impersonation. Legitimate browsers \ntypically include additional version and platform information beyond the base \"Mozilla/5.0\" string.\n"
