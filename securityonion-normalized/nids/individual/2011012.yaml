name: ET SNMP Attempted TCP Access Attempt to Cisco IOS 12.1 Hidden Read/Write Community String ILMI
id: 1248361
description: |
  Detects attempts to access Cisco IOS 12.1 devices using the hidden ILMI community string via TCP.
  May indicate reconnaissance or exploitation of legacy Cisco devices, but could also represent legitimate network management.
