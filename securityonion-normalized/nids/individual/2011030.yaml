questions:
  - question: What was the complete HTTP request containing the Netsparker scan signature?
    context: Reveals the specific URI and request details that triggered the scan detection.
    range: +/-15m

        - http.useragent
        - http.virtual_host
        - http.uri
        - http.status_code
  - question: Does this host normally receive web security scanning traffic?
    context: Determines if security scanning is an expected activity for this web server.

        condition: selection
      fields:
        - dst_ip
  - question: What is the pattern of scan requests from this source IP?
    context: Analyzes the frequency and timing of scan attempts to understand scan methodology.

  - question: Are other hosts also receiving Netsparker scanning activity?
    context: Determines if this is part of a broader network reconnaissance effort.

  - question: What HTTP response codes are being returned to the scanner?
    context: Identifies which scan requests are successful and may reveal application vulnerabilities.
    range: +/-30m
    query: "aggregation: false\nlogsource:\n  category: network\n  service: http\ndetection:\n  selection:\n    src_ip: '{source.ip}'\n    dst_ip: '{destination.ip}'\n  condition: selection\nfields:\n  - http.uri\n  - http.status_code\n  - http.response.body.length\n  \n"
  - question: Is the scanning activity originating from known security testing IP ranges?
    context: Helps determine if this represents authorized security testing or unauthorized reconnaissance.
