name: ET WEB_SERVER Possible SQL injection obfuscated via REVERSE function in HTTP URI
id: 1209905
description: |
  Detects HTTP requests containing the REVERSE function in the URL path, which can indicate SQL injection attempts using obfuscation techniques.
  May trigger on legitimate applications that use REVERSE functions in URLs or automated security testing tools.
