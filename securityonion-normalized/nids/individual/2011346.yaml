name: ET SHELLCODE Possible Unescape %u Shellcode/Heap Spray
id: 1242555
description: |
  Detects JavaScript unescape functions with encoded %u patterns that may indicate shellcode delivery or heap spray attacks.
  May trigger on legitimate JavaScript that uses unescape with Unicode encoding for data processing or compatibility.
