name: ET WEB_CLIENT PDF Name Representation Obfuscation of Pages
id: 1204276
description: |
  Detects PDF files with obfuscated "Pages" keywords using hex encoding, which may indicate attempts to evade security controls.
  May trigger on legitimate PDFs that use standard hex encoding or content management systems that process PDFs.
