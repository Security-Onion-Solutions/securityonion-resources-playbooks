name: ET ADWARE_PUP User-Agent (HTTP_Query)
id: 1210207
description: |
  Detects HTTP requests using the generic "HTTP_Query" user-agent string, commonly associated with adware and potentially unwanted programs (PUPs).
  May also trigger on legitimate applications or scripts that use basic HTTP libraries with default user-agent strings.
