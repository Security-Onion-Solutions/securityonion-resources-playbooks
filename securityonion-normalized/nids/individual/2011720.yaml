name: ET SCAN Possible WafWoof Web Application Firewall Detection Scan
id: 1200016
description: |
  Detects HTTP requests containing the URI pattern "/<invalid>hello.html" associated with WafWoof web application firewall detection scans.
  May trigger on legitimate security testing, vulnerability assessments, or automated reconnaissance tools.

questions:
  - question: What was the complete HTTP request containing the invalid URI pattern?
    context: Reveals the full request structure used in the WAF detection attempt.
    range: +/-15m
    query: |
      aggregation: false
      logsource:
        category: network
        service: http
      detection:
        selection:
          community_id: '{network.community_id}'
        condition: selection
      fields:
        - http.method
        - http.useragent
        - http.virtual_host
        - http.uri
        - http.status_code
  - question: Does this host normally receive requests with unusual URI patterns?
    context: Determines if this represents a deviation from normal web traffic patterns.

        condition: selection
      fields:
        - dst_ip
  - question: What other URI patterns were requested from the same source IP?
    context: Identifies additional reconnaissance or scanning activity from the same origin.
    range: +/-2h
    query: "aggregation: false\nlogsource:\n  category: network\n  service: http\ndetection:\n  selection:\n    src_ip: '{source.ip}'\n    http.method: \"GET\"\n  condition: selection\nfields:\n  - src_ip\n  - dst_ip\n  - http.uri\n  - http.user_agent\n  - http.status_code\n  \n"
  - question: Are other web servers receiving similar WAF detection requests?
    context: Determines if this is part of a broader scanning campaign across multiple targets.

  - question: What user agent was used for the WAF detection request?
    context: Identifies the tool or browser used for the reconnaissance activity.
    range: +/-15m
    query: "aggregation: false\nlogsource:\n  category: network\n  service: http\ndetection:\n  selection:\n    community_id: '{network.community_id}'\n  condition: selection\nfields:\n  - http.user_agent\n  - src_ip\n  - dst_ip\n  - http.uri\n  \n"
  - question: What HTTP response codes were returned to the scanning requests?
    context: Indicates how the web server or WAF responded to the detection attempts.
    range: +/-30m
    query: "aggregation: false\nlogsource:\n  category: network\n  service: http\ndetection:\n  selection:\n    src_ip: '{source.ip}'\n    dst_ip: '{destination.ip}'\n  condition: selection\nfields:\n  - http.status_code\n  - http.uri\n  - http.user_agent\n  \n"
  - question: Did the scanning source attempt connections to other services on the target?
    context: Assesses whether the reconnaissance extended beyond HTTP to other network services.
    range: +/-2h
    query: "aggregation: false\nlogsource:\n  category: network\n  service: connection\ndetection:\n  selection:\n    src_ip: '{source.ip}'\n    dst_ip: '{destination.ip}'\n  filter:\n    dst_port: [80, 443, 8080, 8443]\n  condition: selection and not filter\nfields:\n  - dst_port\n  - network.protocol\n  - connection.state\n  \n"
  - question: What is the timing pattern of requests from this source IP?
    context: Reveals whether this follows automated scanning patterns or manual testing.
