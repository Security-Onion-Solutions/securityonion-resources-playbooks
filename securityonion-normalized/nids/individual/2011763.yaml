name: ET WEB_SERVER Possible Cisco PIX/ASA HTTP Web Interface HTTP Response Splitting Attempt
id: 1200486
description: |
  Detects HTTP requests containing CRLF sequences followed by Location headers that may indicate HTTP response splitting attacks against Cisco PIX/ASA web interfaces.
  May trigger on legitimate applications that handle redirects or proxy configurations with embedded CRLF characters.
