name: ET WEB_SERVER ScriptResource.axd access without t parameter - possible ASP padding-oracle exploit
id: 1209934
description: |
  Detects GET requests to ScriptResource.axd without the time parameter, which may indicate ASP.NET padding oracle exploitation attempts.
  May also trigger on legitimate applications with non-standard ScriptResource configurations or older ASP.NET versions.
