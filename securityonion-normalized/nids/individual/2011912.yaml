name: ET MALWARE Possible Fake AV Checkin
id: 1234059
description: |
  Detects HTTP POST requests to PHP endpoints with specific user-agent patterns and base64-encoded data typical of fake antivirus command-and-control communications.
  May trigger on legitimate applications using similar user-agent strings or base64 data transmission patterns.
