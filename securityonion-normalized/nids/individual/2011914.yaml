questions:
  - question: What was the complete HTTP request containing the DirBuster test string?
    context: Reveals the full request structure and any additional enumeration patterns.
    range: +/-15m
    query: |
      aggregation: false
      logsource:
        category: network
        service: http
      detection:
        selection:
          community_id: '{network.community_id}'
        condition: selection
      fields:
        - http.method
        - http.useragent
        - http.virtual_host
        - http.uri
        - http.status_code
  - question: Does this host normally receive automated scanning traffic?
    context: Determines if this represents unusual reconnaissance activity against the web server.
    range: -7d
    query: |
      aggregation: true
      logsource:
        category: network
        service: http
      detection:
        selection:
          dst_ip: '{destination.ip}'
        condition: selection
      fields:
        - dst_ip
  - question: What web application or service received the DirBuster probe?
    context: Identifies the target application that may be undergoing directory enumeration.
    range: +/-15m
    query: |
      aggregation: false
      logsource:
        category: network
      detection:
        selection:
          community_id: '{network.community_id}'
        filter:
          Image|exists: true
        condition: selection and filter
      fields:
        - hostname
        - User
        - Image
        - CommandLine
        - ProcessGuid
  - question: What other HTTP requests originated from this scanning source?
    context: Reveals the scope and pattern of the directory enumeration attempt.
    range: +/-1h
    query: "aggregation: false\nlogsource:\n  category: network\n  service: http\ndetection:\n  selection:\n    src_ip: '{source.ip}'\n    dst_ip: '{destination.ip}'\n  condition: selection\nfields:\n  - http.method\n  - http.uri\n  - http.user_agent\n  - http.status_code\n  - dst_port\n  \n"
  - question: Are other web servers receiving similar DirBuster scanning attempts?
    context: Determines if this is part of a broader reconnaissance campaign.
    range: +/-6h
    query: |
      aggregation: false
      logsource:
        category: network
        service: connection
      detection:
        selection:
          dst_ip: '{network.public_ip}'
        filter:
          src_ip: '{source.ip}'
        condition: selection and not filter
      fields:
        - src_ip
        - dst_port
        - network.transport
        - connection.state_description
  - question: What user-agent string was used in the DirBuster scanning requests?
    context: Identifies the scanning tool configuration and potential automation patterns.
    range: +/-30m
    query: "aggregation: false\nlogsource:\n  category: network\n  service: http\ndetection:\n  selection:\n    src_ip: '{source.ip}'\n    dst_ip: '{destination.ip}'\n  condition: selection\nfields:\n  - http.user_agent\n  - http.method\n  - http.uri\n  \n"
  - question: What HTTP response codes were returned to the scanning requests?
    context: Indicates which directories or files may have been discovered during enumeration.
    range: +/-1h
    query: "aggregation: true\naggregation_field: http.status_code\nlogsource:\n  category: network\n  service: http\ndetection:\n  selection:\n    src_ip: '{source.ip}'\n    dst_ip: '{destination.ip}'\n  condition: selection\nfields:\n  - http.status_code\n  - http.uri\n  \n"
  - question: Did the scanning activity target any administrative or sensitive directories?
    context: Assesses whether the enumeration focused on high-value application components.
    range: +/-2h
    query: "aggregation: false\nlogsource:\n  category: network\n  service: http\ndetection:\n  selection:\n    src_ip: '{source.ip}'\n    dst_ip: '{destination.ip}'\n    http.uri|contains:\n      - admin\n      - login\n      - config\n      - backup\n      - test\n      - dev\n      - api\n      - wp-admin\n      - phpmyadmin\n  condition: selection\nfields:\n  - http.uri\n  - http.status_code\n  - http.method\n  \n"
  - question: Are there related alerts indicating other reconnaissance techniques from this source?
    context: Identifies coordinated scanning activities beyond directory enumeration.
    range: +/-24h
