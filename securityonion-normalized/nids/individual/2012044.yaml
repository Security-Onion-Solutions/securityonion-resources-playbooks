name: ET WEB_CLIENT Hex Obfuscation of charCodeAt %u UTF-8 Encoding
id: 1220947
description: |
  Detects hex-encoded UTF-8 representation of JavaScript charCodeAt function in HTTP responses.
  This encoding technique is commonly used in browser exploit kits and malicious web content to evade detection.
  May also trigger on legitimate web applications using similar encoding patterns for internationalization.
