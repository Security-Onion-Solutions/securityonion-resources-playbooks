name: ET INFO DNS Query for a Suspicious Malware Related Numerical .in Domain
id: 1257776
description: |
  Detects DNS queries for .in domains consisting only of 4-7 digits, which may indicate
  malware communication or automated activity. May also trigger on legitimate numerical
  domain registrations or business applications using Indian (.in) domains.
