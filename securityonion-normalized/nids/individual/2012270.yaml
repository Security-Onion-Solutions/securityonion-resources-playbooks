name: ET WEB_CLIENT Hex Obfuscation of substr %u UTF-8 Encoding
id: 1221365
description: |
  Detects hex-encoded UTF-8 obfuscation of the substr JavaScript function in HTTP responses.
  May indicate exploit kit activity or malicious JavaScript delivery, but could also trigger on legitimate minified JavaScript code or encoding libraries.
