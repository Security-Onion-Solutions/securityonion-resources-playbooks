name: ET WEB_CLIENT Likely Redirector to Exploit Page /in/rdrct/rckt/?
id: 1246447
description: |
  Detects HTTP requests to URLs containing the path "/in/rdrct/rckt/?" which may indicate
  redirector infrastructure leading to exploit kits. May trigger on legitimate redirector
  services or advertising platforms using similar URI patterns.
