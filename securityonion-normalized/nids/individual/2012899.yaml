name: ET INFO HTTP Request to a *.qc.cx domain
id: 1205298
description: |
  Detects HTTP requests to domains ending in .qc.cx, which may be used for dynamic DNS, tunneling, or legitimate web services.
  This pattern is commonly seen with dynamic DNS providers but may also indicate data exfiltration or C2 communications.
