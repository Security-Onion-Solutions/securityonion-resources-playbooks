name: ET ADWARE_PUP Known Malicious User-Agent (x) Win32/Tracur.A or OneStep Adware Related
id: 1211303
description: |
  Detects HTTP connections using the single character "x" as a user agent string, which is associated with Win32/Tracur.A adware or OneStep adware families.
  May occasionally trigger on legitimate applications with minimal user agent strings or testing tools.
