name: ET EXPLOIT Likely Generic Java Exploit Attempt Request for Java to decimal host
id: 1243022
description: |
  Detects Java applications making requests to hosts specified as decimal IP addresses,
  which may indicate exploitation attempts targeting Java vulnerabilities. May trigger on
  legitimate Java applications or network tools using decimal IP notation.
