name: ET MALWARE Win32/Daemonize Trojan Proxy Initial Checkin
id: 1252865
description: |
  Detects HTTP requests to /command.php with specific ID parameters and single-character user agents
  that match Win32/Daemonize trojan proxy communication patterns. May trigger on legitimate applications
  using similar URI patterns or minimal user agents.
