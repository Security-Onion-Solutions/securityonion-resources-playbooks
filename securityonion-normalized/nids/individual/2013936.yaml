name: ET INFO SSH banner detected on TCP 443 likely proxy evasion
id: 1257687
description: |
  Detects SSH banners on TCP port 443, which typically indicates SSH traffic tunneling through HTTPS port for proxy evasion.
  May represent legitimate SSH-over-HTTPS tunneling configurations or potential policy violations.
