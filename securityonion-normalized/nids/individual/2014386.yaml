name: ET DOS Microsoft Remote Desktop (RDP) Session Established Flowbit Set
id: 1245738
description: |
  Detects established RDP sessions to internal hosts. This rule tracks legitimate RDP connections
  and sets flowbits for subsequent RDP-related detections. May indicate normal remote administration
  or potential lateral movement activity.
