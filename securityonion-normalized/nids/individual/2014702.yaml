name: ET DNS Non-DNS or Non-Compliant DNS traffic on DNS port Opcode 8 through 15 set
id: 1247437
description: |
  Detects DNS traffic with non-standard opcodes (8-15) on port 53, which may indicate DNS tunneling,
  covert channels, or malformed DNS implementations. Can also trigger on legitimate DNS software testing
  or network troubleshooting tools.
