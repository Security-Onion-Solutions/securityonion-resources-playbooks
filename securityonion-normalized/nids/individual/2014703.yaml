name: ET DNS Non-DNS or Non-Compliant DNS traffic on DNS port Reserved Bit Set
id: 1248032
description: |
  Detects DNS traffic with reserved bit set in the DNS header, indicating non-compliant DNS traffic or potential DNS tunneling.
  May trigger on legitimate DNS implementations with non-standard flag handling or DNS security tools.
