name: ET WEB_SERVER IIS 8.3 Filename With Wildcard (Possible File/Dir Bruteforce)
id: 1209916
description: |
  Detects HTTP requests containing 8.3 filename patterns with wildcards targeting IIS servers.
  May indicate file/directory bruteforce attempts exploiting Microsoft IIS tilde character vulnerability.
  Could also trigger on legitimate applications using 8.3 filename conventions.
