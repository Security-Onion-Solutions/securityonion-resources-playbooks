name: ET MALWARE Karagany checkin (sid5 1)
id: 1252309
description: |
  Detects HTTP requests with specific URI parameters (?f=, &t=, &sid5=) and missing Accept headers characteristic of Karagany malware communication.
  May trigger on legitimate applications using similar parameter patterns or custom HTTP clients with non-standard headers.
