name: ET MALWARE Karagany checkin (sid5 2)
id: 1252310
description: |
  Detects HTTP requests with specific URI parameters (?mode=, &f=, &sid5=) and missing Accept headers that match Karagany malware C2 communication patterns.
  May trigger on legitimate applications using similar URI parameter patterns or custom HTTP clients.
