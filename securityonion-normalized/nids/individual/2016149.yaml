name: ET INFO Session Traversal Utilities for NAT (STUN Binding Request)
id: 1213223
description: |
  Detects STUN binding requests used for NAT traversal in applications like VoIP, video conferencing, and P2P communications.
  Common in legitimate WebRTC applications, VoIP clients, and video conferencing tools, but may also indicate unauthorized P2P activity.
