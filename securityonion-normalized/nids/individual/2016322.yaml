name: ET DOS LibuPnP CVE-2012-5958 ST DeviceType Buffer Overflow
id: 1245717
description: |
  Detects UPnP SSDP packets with malformed ST headers that could exploit CVE-2012-5958 buffer overflow vulnerability.
  May trigger on legitimate UPnP discovery with unusual device type strings or network scanning tools.
