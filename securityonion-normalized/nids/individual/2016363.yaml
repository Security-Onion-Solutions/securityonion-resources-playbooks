name: ET DOS Miniupnpd M-SEARCH Buffer Overflow (CVE-2013-0229)
id: 1245716
description: |
  Detects UDP traffic containing oversized UPnP M-SEARCH requests that may exploit CVE-2013-0229 buffer overflow vulnerability in miniupnpd.
  May trigger on legitimate UPnP discovery traffic or network scanning tools testing UPnP services.
