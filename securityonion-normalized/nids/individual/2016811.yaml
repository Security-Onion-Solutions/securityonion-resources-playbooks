name: ET EXPLOIT_KIT - Possible Redkit 1-4 char JNLP request
id: 1212763
description: |
  Detects short JNLP (Java Network Launch Protocol) requests with 1-4 character filenames that match Redkit exploit kit patterns.
  May trigger on legitimate Java Web Start applications using short JNLP filenames or automated deployment tools.
