questions:
  - question: What was the complete HTTP request containing the Arachni scanner signature?
    context: Reveals the full scanning request pattern and targeted URI paths.
    range: +/-15m
    query: |
      aggregation: false
      logsource:
        category: network
        service: http
      detection:
        selection:
          community_id: '{network.community_id}'
        condition: selection
      fields:
        - http.method
        - http.useragent
        - http.virtual_host
        - http.uri
        - http.status_code
  - question: Does this host normally receive web security scans or penetration testing?
    context: Determines if this scanning activity represents authorized security testing.

        condition: selection
      fields:
        - dst_ip
  - question: What other URIs were requested by this source IP during the scanning activity?
    context: Identifies the scope and methodology of the web application scan.
    range: +/-30m
    query: "aggregation: false\nlogsource:\n  category: network\n  service: http\ndetection:\n  selection:\n    src_ip: '{source.ip}'\n    dst_ip: '{destination.ip}'\n  condition: selection\nfields:\n  - http.uri\n  - http.method\n  - http.status_code\n  - http.user_agent\n  \n"
  - question: What HTTP response codes were returned to the Arachni scanner requests?
    context: Indicates which scan probes were successful or returned error conditions.
    range: +/-30m
    query: "aggregation: false\nlogsource:\n  category: network\n  service: http\ndetection:\n  selection:\n    src_ip: '{source.ip}'\n    dst_ip: '{destination.ip}'\n    http.uri|contains: \"Arachni-\"\n  condition: selection\nfields:\n  - http.status_code\n  - http.uri\n  - http.response.body.length\n  \n"
  - question: Are other web servers receiving similar Arachni scanning patterns?
    context: Determines if this is part of a broader reconnaissance campaign.
