name: ET MALWARE Bladabindi/njrat CnC Keep-Alive (OUTBOUND)
id: 1241379
description: |
  Detects Bladabindi/njrat malware keep-alive communications containing "P[endof]" pattern sent to external servers.
  This specific 8-byte pattern is characteristic of njrat C2 heartbeat traffic but could potentially match other applications using similar protocols.
