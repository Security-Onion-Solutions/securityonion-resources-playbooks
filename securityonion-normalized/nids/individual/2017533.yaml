name: ET EXPLOIT_KIT Possible LightsOut EK sort.html
id: 1244631
description: |
  Detects HTTP requests to /sort.html which may indicate LightsOut exploit kit activity.
  This URI pattern has been observed in watering hole attacks targeting the energy sector.
  May trigger on legitimate applications that use similar URI patterns for sorting functionality.
