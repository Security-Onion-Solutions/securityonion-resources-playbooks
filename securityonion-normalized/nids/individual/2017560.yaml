name: ET WEB_SPECIFIC_APPS Possible WHMCS SQLi AES_ENCRYPT at start of value
id: 1209921
description: |
  Detects HTTP requests containing AES_ENCRYPT SQL function calls in URL parameters, potentially indicating SQL injection attempts against WHMCS applications.
  May trigger on legitimate database administration tools or applications that properly handle encrypted SQL operations.
