name: ET WEB_SERVER Possible Encrypted Webshell Download
id: 1209984
description: |
  Detects HTTP responses containing both 'eval' and 'mcrypt_decrypt' functions, which may indicate encrypted webshell downloads.
  May also trigger on legitimate PHP applications using encryption functions or development tools with encryption libraries.
