name: ET MALWARE Possible Trojan.APT.9002 POST
id: 1234105
description: |
  Detects HTTP POST requests to hex-encoded paths using the lynx user-agent, consistent with Trojan.APT.9002 command and control communication.
  May trigger on legitimate applications using similar URL patterns or lynx browser usage.
