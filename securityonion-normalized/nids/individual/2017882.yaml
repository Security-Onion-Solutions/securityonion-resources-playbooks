name: ET WEB_SERVER Apache Solr Arbitrary XSLT inclusion attack (CVE-2013-6397)
id: 1245931
description: |
  Detects Apache Solr requests containing path traversal sequences and XSLT parameters that match CVE-2013-6397 exploitation patterns.
  May trigger on legitimate Solr queries using custom XSLT transformations or security scanning tools.
