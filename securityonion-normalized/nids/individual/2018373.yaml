name: ET RETIRED Malformed HeartBeat Response
id: 1210350
description: |
  Detects malformed TLS heartbeat responses that may indicate exploitation of the Heartbleed vulnerability (CVE-2014-0160).
  May trigger on legitimate TLS implementations with non-standard heartbeat handling or network issues affecting packet reassembly.
