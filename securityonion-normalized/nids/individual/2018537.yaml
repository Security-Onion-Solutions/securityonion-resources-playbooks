name: ET WEB_CLIENT Possible GnuTLS Client ServerHello SessionID Overflow CVE-2014-3466
id: 1246301
description: |
  Detects potential GnuTLS client vulnerability exploitation where malformed TLS ServerHello messages
  could cause buffer overflow. May trigger on legitimate TLS handshakes with unusual session ID lengths
  or timestamp variations in certificate validity periods.
