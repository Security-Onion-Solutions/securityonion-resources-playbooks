name: ET MALWARE Backdoor family PCRat/Gh0st CnC traffic (OUTBOUND)
id: 1235220
description: |
  Detects outbound command and control traffic associated with PCRat/Gh0st backdoor families.
  These backdoors establish persistent connections to remote servers for command execution and data exfiltration.
  May occasionally trigger on legitimate applications using similar binary protocols.
