name: ET MALWARE Ddex Loader Check-in
id: 1238911
description: |
  Detects HTTP GET requests with specific parameter patterns (t=, o=, i=, task_id=) to PHP endpoints that match Ddex malware loader check-in behavior.
  May trigger on legitimate applications using similar parameter structures or automated tools performing health checks.
