name: ET INFO Session Traversal Utilities for NAT (STUN Binding Request obsolete rfc 3489 CHANGE-REQUEST attribute change IP flag false change port flag true)
id: 1257181
description: |
  Detects STUN binding requests using obsolete RFC 3489 with CHANGE-REQUEST attribute specifying change port flag true and change IP flag false.
  This is normal behavior for applications using NAT traversal protocols like VoIP, video conferencing, and P2P applications.
