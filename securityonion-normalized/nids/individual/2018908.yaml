name: ET INFO Session Traversal Utilities for NAT (STUN Binding Response)
id: 1257184
description: |
  Detects STUN binding response messages, which are part of normal NAT traversal for applications
  like VoIP, video conferencing, and P2P communications. May indicate legitimate network services
  or could be used by malware for NAT traversal and network reconnaissance.
