id: 1244743
description: |
  Detects HTTP requests containing specific parameter patterns (v_ja, v_f, v_m, v_s, v_a, v_q, js, ref) commonly used by exploit kits for browser and plugin fingerprinting.
  May trigger on legitimate web applications that perform similar browser capability detection or analytics tracking.
