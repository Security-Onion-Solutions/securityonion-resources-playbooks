name: ET DOS Likely NTP DDoS In Progress PEER_LIST_SUM Response to Non-Ephemeral Port
id: 1200244
description: |
  Detects NTP PEER_LIST_SUM responses sent to non-ephemeral ports, indicating potential DDoS amplification attacks.
  May trigger on legitimate NTP monitoring tools or network diagnostics using non-standard ports.
