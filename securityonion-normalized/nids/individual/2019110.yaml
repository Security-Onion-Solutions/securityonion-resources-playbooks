name: ET WEB_SERVER Likely Malicious Request for /proc/self/fd/
id: 1222085
description: |
  Detects HTTP requests attempting to access /proc/self/fd/ paths, which may indicate
  path traversal attempts or reconnaissance of Linux file descriptors. May trigger on
  legitimate system administration tools or applications that access proc filesystem.
