name: ET MALWARE W32/Waterspout.APT Backdoor CnC Beacon
id: 1201019
description: |
  Detects HTTP GET requests to PHP endpoints with specific URI patterns and base64-encoded parameters consistent with W32/Waterspout APT backdoor command and control communications.
  May trigger on legitimate applications using similar URI structures or base64 encoding patterns.
