name: ET MALWARE Win32/Hikit Server Authentication Response
id: 1239746
description: |
  Detects HTTP responses containing ETag headers with specific patterns used by the Win32/Hikit malware family for command and control authentication.
  May trigger on legitimate applications using similar ETag formats or web services with overlapping authentication patterns.
