name: ET MALWARE AnubisNetworks Sinkhole TCP Connection
id: 1255722
description: |
  Detects TCP connections to the AnubisNetworks sinkhole infrastructure (195.22.26.192/26).
  These connections typically indicate malware attempting to communicate with command and control servers that have been redirected to this sinkhole for analysis and mitigation.
