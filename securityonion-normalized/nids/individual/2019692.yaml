name: ET MALWARE Possible Emotet DGA NXDOMAIN Responses
id: 1239567
description: |
  Detects DNS responses with NXDOMAIN status for 16-character alphabetic domains ending in .eu, which matches Emotet Domain Generation Algorithm (DGA) patterns.
  May trigger on legitimate DNS failures for European domains or other applications using similar domain patterns.
