name: ET DOS MC-SQLR Response Inbound Possible DDoS Target
id: 1200096
description: |
  Detects multiple inbound MC-SQLR responses from SQL Server instances which may indicate
  the host is being targeted in a DDoS amplification attack. May also trigger on legitimate
  SQL Server discovery activities or network scanning.
