name: ET INFO I2P Seeds File Request
id: 1213760
description: |
  Detects HTTP requests for I2P network seed files (i2pseeds.su3). These files are used to bootstrap I2P anonymous network connections.
  May indicate legitimate I2P client setup or potential use of anonymization networks for privacy or evasion purposes.
