name: ET MALWARE Arid Viper APT Possible User-Agent (SK)
id: 1233806
description: |
  Detects HTTP connections using a minimal 2-character "SK" user-agent with specific header patterns.
  This user-agent signature has been associated with Arid Viper APT group operations but may also appear in legitimate automation tools or custom applications.
