name: ET EXPLOIT FREAK Weak Export Suite From Server (CVE-2015-0204)
id: 1243192
description: |
  Detects TLS servers offering weak export-grade cipher suites that can be exploited via the FREAK attack.
  May trigger on legacy servers or clients configured to support weak ciphers for compatibility.
