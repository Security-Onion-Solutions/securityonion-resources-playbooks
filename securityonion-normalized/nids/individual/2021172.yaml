name: ET DOS Possible Sentinal LM Amplification attack (Request) Inbound
id: 1200423
description: |
  Detects UDP requests to port 5093 with specific 6-byte pattern that may indicate Sentinal License Manager amplification attacks.
  May trigger on legitimate Sentinal License Manager client requests or network scanning activity.
