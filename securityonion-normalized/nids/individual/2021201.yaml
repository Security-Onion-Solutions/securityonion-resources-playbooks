name: ET MALWARE Sakula/Mivast RAT CnC Beacon 3
id: 1218085
description: |
  Detects HTTP GET requests to .asp endpoints with specific parameter patterns (resid= and photoid=) and restricted header combinations that match Sakula/Mivast RAT command and control communications.
  May trigger on legitimate web applications using similar ASP parameter patterns.
