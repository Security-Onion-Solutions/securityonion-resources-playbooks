name: ET MALWARE Win32/Chinad Checkin
id: 1238563
description: |
  Detects Win32/Chinad malware making checkin requests to command and control servers.
  The pattern involves GET requests to /api/?a= endpoints on IP-based hosts, which is characteristic of this malware family's C2 communication protocol.
