id: 1222261
description: |
  Detects HTTP requests to URLs with specific patterns (8-character names followed by .php?id= and 6-9 digits) that may indicate malicious redirects or exploit kit activity.
  May trigger on legitimate applications using similar URL structures or content management systems with numeric identifiers.
