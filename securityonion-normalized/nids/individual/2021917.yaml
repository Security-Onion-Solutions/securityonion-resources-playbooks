name: ET MALWARE ELF/muBoT User-Agent (I'm a mu mu mu ?)
id: 1240075
description: |
  Detects HTTP requests containing the distinctive "I'm a mu mu mu ?" user-agent string associated with ELF/muBoT malware.
  This specific user-agent pattern is characteristic of muBoT botnet communications and indicates potential Linux system compromise.
