name: ET MALWARE r0 CnC Architecture GET 1
id: 1238842
description: |
  Detects HTTP GET requests to URIs starting with "/i686?ver=" using a specific Firefox 36.0 user-agent and "Expect: 100-continue" header.
  This pattern is associated with r0 botnet command and control communications but may trigger on legitimate software with similar characteristics.
