name: ET MALWARE Win32/Swrort.A Checkin 3
id: 1233368
description: |
  Detects HTTP GET requests to .php URLs with specific parameter patterns and missing standard headers, consistent with Win32/Swrort.A malware check-in behavior.
  May trigger on legitimate applications using similar URL patterns or custom HTTP clients with minimal headers.
