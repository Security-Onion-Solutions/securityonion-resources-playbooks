name: ET EXPLOIT Possible CVE-2016-1287 Invalid Fragment Size Inbound 2
id: 1215786
description: |
  Detects UDP traffic with invalid fragment sizes that may exploit CVE-2016-1287 in firewall implementations.
  May trigger on legitimate IKE/IPSec traffic with unusual fragmentation or network testing tools.
