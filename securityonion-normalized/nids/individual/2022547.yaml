name: ET EXPLOIT Possible CVE-2015-7547 Large Response to A/AAAA query
id: 1212827
description: |
  Detects large DNS responses (>2048 bytes) to A/AAAA queries that may exploit CVE-2015-7547 glibc vulnerability.
  May trigger on legitimate DNS responses for domains with many A records or large TXT records.
