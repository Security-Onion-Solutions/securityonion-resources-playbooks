name: ET INFO Possible Psiphon Proxy Tool traffic
id: 1205949
description: |
  Detects HTTP traffic patterns consistent with Psiphon proxy tool usage, characterized by specific POST requests with base64-encoded cookies and minimal headers.
  May indicate legitimate circumvention tool usage or potential data exfiltration through proxy channels.
