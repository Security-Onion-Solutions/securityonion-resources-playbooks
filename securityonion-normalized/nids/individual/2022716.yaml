id: 1249686
description: |
  Detects HTTP GET requests to external servers with specific URI parameters (.sh?do=, &d=, &inj=, &cl=, &cs=, &id=, &se=) and a Mozilla/5.0 user-agent pattern without referer headers, characteristic of OSX/Adware.Pirrit command and control communications.
  May also trigger on legitimate shell script downloads or applications using similar parameter patterns.
