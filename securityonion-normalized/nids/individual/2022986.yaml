name: ET MALWARE Generic Request to gate.php Dotted-Quad
id: 1219507
description: |
  Detects HTTP requests to gate.php on servers identified by IP address rather than domain name.
  This pattern is commonly used by malware for C2 communication but may also occur in legitimate automated systems or direct IP access scenarios.
