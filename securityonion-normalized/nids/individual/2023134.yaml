name: ET MALWARE Possible Pegasus/Trident Related HTTP Beacon 4
id: 1240115
description: |
  Detects HTTP requests with URI patterns matching Pegasus/Trident spyware beacon activity.
  The specific pattern (.html?s=<value>&d=<value>) is associated with NSO Group's surveillance tools.
  May occasionally trigger on legitimate applications using similar URL parameter structures.
