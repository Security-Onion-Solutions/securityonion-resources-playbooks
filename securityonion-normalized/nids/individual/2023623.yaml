name: ET MALWARE Ransomware/Cerber Checkin M3 (12)
id: 1250008
description: |
  Detects UDP communications to external hosts on ports 6892/6893 containing short hexadecimal strings.
  This pattern matches Cerber ransomware command and control communication but may also occur with legitimate applications using similar hexadecimal identifiers.
