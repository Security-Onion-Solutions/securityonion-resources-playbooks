name: ET MALWARE APT28 Uploader Variant CnC Beacon
id: 1239159
description: |
  Detects APT28 uploader variant C2 beacon traffic using specific POST requests with base64-encoded parameters and the Mozi user agent.
  May occasionally trigger on legitimate applications using similar HTTP patterns or base64 encoding in POST requests.
