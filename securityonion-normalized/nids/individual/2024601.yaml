name: ET MALWARE Win32/Datper CnC Activity
id: 1200770
description: |
  Detects HTTP GET requests to PHP scripts with hex-encoded parameters and specific Internet Explorer user agent patterns consistent with Datper malware C2 communications.
  May trigger on legitimate applications using similar URL patterns or older IE browsers with comparable request structures.
