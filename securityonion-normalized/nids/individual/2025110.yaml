name: ET INFO Suspicious Domain (*.ml) in TLS SNI
id: 1205128
description: |
  Detects TLS connections to domains using the .ml TLD, which has historically been associated with suspicious activity due to its free registration model.
  May trigger on legitimate connections to Mali-based websites or services using .ml domains.
