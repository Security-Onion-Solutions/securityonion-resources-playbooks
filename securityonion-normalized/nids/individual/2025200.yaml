name: ET MALWARE OSX/Mami Possible DNS Query to Evil DNS Server
id: 1239670
description: |
  Detects DNS queries to servers associated with OSX/Mami malware. This malware hijacks DNS settings
  to redirect traffic through malicious servers. May trigger on legitimate queries if DNS configuration
  changes are made or if these IPs are later reassigned.
