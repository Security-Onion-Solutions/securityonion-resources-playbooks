name: ET USER_AGENTS Suspicious User-Agent (Windows 10)
id: 1226072
description: |
  Detects HTTP requests with user-agent strings claiming to be "Windows 10" which may indicate simplified or fake user-agent strings.
  May trigger on legitimate applications, custom tools, or automated systems using basic user-agent identification.
