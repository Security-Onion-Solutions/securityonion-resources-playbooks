name: ET ATTACK_RESPONSE PowerShell Execution String Base64 Encoded Start-Process (FydC1Qcm9) in DNS TXT Response
id: 1202558
description: |
  Detects DNS TXT responses containing base64-encoded PowerShell Start-Process commands.
  This pattern indicates DNS tunneling for command execution, commonly used by DNSlivery and similar tools.
  May trigger on legitimate DNS-based configuration management systems using encoded commands.
