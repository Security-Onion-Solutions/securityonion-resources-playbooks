name: ET ATTACK_RESPONSE PowerShell Execution String Base64 Encoded Invoke-Command in DNS TXT Response
id: 1202568
description: |
  Detects DNS TXT responses containing base64-encoded PowerShell Invoke-Command strings, indicating potential DNS tunneling for PowerShell command delivery.
  May trigger on legitimate DNS TXT records containing similar base64 patterns or PowerShell automation tools.
