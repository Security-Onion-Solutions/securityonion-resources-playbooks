name: ET ATTACK_RESPONSE UTF8 base64 wide string /This Program/ in DNS TXT Response
id: 1202506
description: |
  Detects DNS TXT responses containing base64-encoded wide strings with "This Program" pattern.
  May indicate DNS-based data exfiltration or command-and-control communication using tools like DNSlivery.
  Could also trigger on legitimate DNS TXT records containing encoded software information.
