name: ET ATTACK_RESPONSE UTF8 base64 wide string /This Program/ in DNS TXT Response
id: 1202794
description: |
  Detects DNS TXT responses containing base64-encoded wide string "This Program" pattern.
  May indicate DNSlivery toolkit usage for DNS-based data exfiltration or command delivery.
  Could also trigger on legitimate software distribution or update mechanisms using DNS TXT records.
