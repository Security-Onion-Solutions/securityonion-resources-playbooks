name: ET ATTACK_RESPONSE UTF8 base64 reversed string /This Program/ in DNS TXT Response
id: 1204707
description: |
  Detects DNS TXT responses containing base64-encoded reversed "This Program" strings, indicating potential DNSlivery tool usage.
  May indicate DNS tunneling for command and control or data exfiltration, but could also trigger on legitimate base64 content in DNS records.
