name: ET USER_AGENTS Fake Mozilla User-Agent String Observed (M0zilla)
id: 1228108
description: |
  Detects HTTP requests using a malformed Mozilla user-agent string with '0' instead of 'o'.
  This pattern is commonly used by malware families to mimic legitimate browser traffic while maintaining a unique signature for command and control communications.
