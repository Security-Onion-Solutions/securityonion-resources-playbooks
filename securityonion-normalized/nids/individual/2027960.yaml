name: ET EXPLOIT Possible EXIM RCE Inbound (CVE-2019-15846) M2
id: 1212009
description: |
  Detects TLS connections with specific byte patterns in SNI fields that may indicate CVE-2019-15846 exploitation attempts.
  May trigger on legitimate TLS connections with unusual SNI formatting or network scanning tools.
