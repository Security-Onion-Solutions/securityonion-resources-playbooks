name: ET MALWARE APT 41 LOWKEY Backdoor - Initialization Bytes Received from CnC
id: 1217897
description: |
  Detects specific initialization bytes from APT 41 LOWKEY backdoor command and control communications.
  Traffic to port 53 may appear as DNS but could be tunneled C2 communications or legitimate DNS with unusual patterns.
