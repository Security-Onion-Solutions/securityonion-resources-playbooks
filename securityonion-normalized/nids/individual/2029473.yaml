name: ET SCAN ELF/Mirai User-Agent Observed (Inbound)
id: 1200302
description: |
  Detects inbound HTTP requests with the "Ankit" user-agent string, commonly associated with Mirai botnet scanning activity.
  May trigger on legitimate applications or testing tools that use this specific user-agent pattern.
