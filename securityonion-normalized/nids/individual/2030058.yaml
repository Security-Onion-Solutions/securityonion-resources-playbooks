name: ET USER_AGENTS Observed Suspicious UA (h55u4u4u5uii5)
id: 1227724
description: |
  Detects HTTP traffic using the user-agent string "h55u4u4u5uii5" associated with Grandoreiro banking trojan.
  May trigger on legitimate applications using this specific user-agent pattern, though this is extremely unlikely.
