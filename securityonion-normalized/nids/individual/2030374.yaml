name: ET MALWARE ELF/Mirai Variant User-Agent (Outbound)
id: 1201039
description: |
  Detects outbound HTTP connections using the specific user-agent "Hello, pee" associated with ELF/Mirai malware variants.
  This user-agent pattern is characteristic of IoT botnet communications and is highly specific to malicious activity.
