name: ET EXPLOIT Possible CVE-2020-11896/CVE-2020-11898 Fragments inside IP-in-IP tunnel
id: 1242717
description: |
  Detects fragmented packets inside IP-in-IP tunnels that may exploit CVE-2020-11896/CVE-2020-11898 vulnerabilities.
  May trigger on legitimate fragmented traffic in VPN or tunneling configurations using IP-in-IP encapsulation.
