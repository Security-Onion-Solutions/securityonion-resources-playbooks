name: ET INFO Suspicious Outbound SIG DNS Query
id: 1213814
description: |
  Detects DNS queries that begin with numeric characters, which may indicate programmatic generation or certain types of DNS tunneling.
  May trigger on legitimate applications using numeric identifiers or subdomains that start with numbers.
