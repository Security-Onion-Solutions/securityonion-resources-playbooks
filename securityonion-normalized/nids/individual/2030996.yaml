name: ET MALWARE ELF/Mirai Variant User-Agent (Outbound)
id: 1215334
description: |
  Detects outbound HTTP connections using the "JuffHell/" user-agent string associated with ELF/Mirai malware variants.
  This user-agent is characteristic of IoT botnet communications and is rarely seen in legitimate traffic.
