name: ET MALWARE ComRAT CnC Domain in DNS Lookup
id: 1214392
description: |
  Detects DNS queries to the domain sanitar.ml, which is associated with ComRAT command and control infrastructure.
  ComRAT is a Remote Access Trojan that uses DNS queries for C2 communication. May also trigger on legitimate DNS queries if the domain is reused.
