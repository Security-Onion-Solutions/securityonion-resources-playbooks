name: ET INFO Observed ZeroSSL Certificate for Suspicious TLD (.icu)
id: 1205918
description: |
  Detects TLS certificates issued by ZeroSSL for .icu domains. ZeroSSL is a legitimate certificate authority,
  and .icu domains may be used for legitimate purposes, though this TLD is sometimes associated with suspicious activities.
