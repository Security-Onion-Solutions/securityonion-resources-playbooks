name: ET MALWARE Win32/TrickBot maserv Module CnC Activity
id: 1233711
description: |
  Detects TrickBot malware maserv module communicating with command and control servers using specific POST requests with form-data containing port scan results.
  May trigger on legitimate applications using similar multipart form-data patterns, though the specific combination of URI and content is highly indicative of TrickBot activity.
