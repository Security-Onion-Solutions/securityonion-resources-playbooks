name: ET EXPLOIT DD-WRT UPNP Unauthenticated Buffer Overflow (CVE-2021-27137)
id: 1212871
description: |
  Detects UPNP M-SEARCH requests with unusually long headers that may exploit CVE-2021-27137 buffer overflow vulnerability in DD-WRT devices.
  May trigger on legitimate UPNP discovery traffic with extended headers or network scanning tools testing UPNP services.
