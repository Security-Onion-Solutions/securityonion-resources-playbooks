name: ET MALWARE SLIGHTPULSE Webshell Activity M3
id: 1233831
description: |
  Detects SLIGHTPULSE webshell activity based on specific HTTP response patterns including 200 status codes with no-cache headers and image/gif content type.
  May trigger on legitimate web applications serving GIF images with cache-control headers or content management systems.
