name: ET HUNTING Possible ELF executable sent when remote host claims to send a Text File
id: 1205069
description: |
  Detects HTTP responses where the server claims to send a text file but actually delivers an ELF executable.
  May trigger on legitimate software downloads or mirror sites that mislabel content types.
