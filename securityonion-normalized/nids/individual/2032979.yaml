description: |
  Identifies HTTP requests with YandexBot user agent string indicating Yandex search engine crawling activity.
  Legitimate when from Yandex infrastructure, but may indicate user agent spoofing or reconnaissance.

questions:
  - question: What was the complete HTTP request with the YandexBot user agent?
    context: Shows the exact crawling pattern and requested resources.

        - http.uri
        - http.status_code
  - question: Does this web server normally receive traffic from search engine crawlers?
    context: Establishes if web crawling is typical for this service.

        condition: selection
      fields:
        - dst_ip
  - question: What other user agents accessed this web server during the same timeframe?
    context: Identifies patterns of legitimate crawling versus potential spoofing.
    range: +/-1h
    query: "aggregation: false\nlogsource:\n  category: network\n  service: http\ndetection:\n  selection:\n    dst_ip: '{destination.ip}'\n    dst_port: '{destination.port}'\n  condition: selection\nfields:\n  - src_ip\n  - http.user_agent\n  - http.uri\n  - http.method\n  \n"
  - question: Are the source IPs consistent with known Yandex infrastructure?
    context: Validates whether requests originate from legitimate Yandex crawling infrastructure.
    range: +/-24h
    query: "aggregation: false\nlogsource:\n  category: network\n  service: http\ndetection:\n  selection:\n    dst_ip: '{destination.ip}'\n    http.user_agent|contains: \"YandexBot\"\n  condition: selection\nfields:\n  - src_ip\n  - http.user_agent\n  - dst_ip\n  - dst_port\n  \n"
  - question: What specific web resources was the YandexBot attempting to access?
    context: Reveals crawling patterns and potential reconnaissance targets.
    range: +/-30m
    query: "aggregation: false\nlogsource:\n  category: network\n  service: http\ndetection:\n  selection:\n    src_ip: '{source.ip}'\n    http.user_agent|contains: \"YandexBot\"\n  condition: selection\nfields:\n  - http.uri\n  - http.method\n  - http.status_code\n  - dst_ip\n  \n"
  - question: Did the same source IP use different user agents?
    context: Identifies potential user agent spoofing or mixed crawling behavior.
    range: +/-6h
    query: "aggregation: false\nlogsource:\n  category: network\n  service: http\ndetection:\n  selection:\n    src_ip: '{source.ip}'\n  condition: selection\nfields:\n  - http.user_agent\n  - http.uri\n  - dst_ip\n  - dst_port\n  \n"
  - question: Are other hosts receiving similar YandexBot requests?
    context: Determines if this is part of broader crawling activity across the network.
    range: +/-24h

  - question: What was the timing pattern of requests from this source?
