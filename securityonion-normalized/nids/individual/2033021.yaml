id: 1252211
description: |
  Detects HTTP GET requests to randomly generated domains with specific URI patterns and minimal headers, consistent with Lemon_Duck malware C2 communications.
  May trigger on legitimate applications using similar domain patterns or automated tools with minimal HTTP headers.
