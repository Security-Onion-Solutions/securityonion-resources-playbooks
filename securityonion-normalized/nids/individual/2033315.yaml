name: ET USER_AGENTS Observed Malicious User-Agent (Brute Force Attacks)
id: 1227759
description: |
  Detects HTTP requests using a specific Microsoft Office/Outlook user-agent string associated with brute force attacks by threat actors.
  May trigger on legitimate Microsoft Office applications making HTTP requests, though this specific version string is uncommon.
