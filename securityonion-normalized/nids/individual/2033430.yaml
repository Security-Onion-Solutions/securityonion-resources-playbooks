name: ET HUNTING NOP Sled in HTTP Header Inbound - Possible Exploit Activity
id: 1229263
description: |
  Detects HTTP requests containing sequences of NOP (No Operation) instructions in headers.
  May indicate exploitation attempts using buffer overflows or shellcode delivery, but could also trigger on legitimate binary data or encoded content in headers.
