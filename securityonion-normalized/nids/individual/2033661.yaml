name: ET EXPLOIT [PwnedPiper] Exploitation Attempt - Small Malformed Translogic Packet (Multiple CVEs)
id: 1212264
description: |
  Detects malformed Translogic pneumatic tube system packets that may exploit multiple CVEs including CVE-2021-37162, CVE-2021-37165, and CVE-2021-37161.
  May trigger on legitimate Translogic system traffic or network scanning of UDP port 12345.
