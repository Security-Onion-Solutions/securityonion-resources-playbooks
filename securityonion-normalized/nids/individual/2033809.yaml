name: ET MALWARE SNIcat - Detected C2 Commands (finito)
id: 1235483
description: |
  Detects SNIcat C2 communication using TLS Server Name Indication (SNI) fields containing "finito-" patterns.
  SNIcat is a covert channel tool that tunnels commands through TLS SNI fields, appearing as legitimate HTTPS traffic.
