name: ET INFO Microsoft Netconnection Domain in DNS Lookup
id: 1213221
description: |
  Detects DNS queries for internetbeacon.msedge.net, which is used by PowerShell's Test-NetConnection cmdlet
  to verify internet connectivity. This is typically legitimate administrative activity but may indicate
  network testing or reconnaissance if unexpected.
