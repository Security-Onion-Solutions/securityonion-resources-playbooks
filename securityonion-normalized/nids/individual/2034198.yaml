name: ET INFO Interactsh Domain in DNS Lookup (.interact .sh)
id: 1200115
description: |
  Detects DNS queries to Interactsh domains ending in .interact.sh.
  Interactsh is a legitimate OAST tool used by security researchers for vulnerability testing,
  but may also be used in exploitation attempts or security scanning.
