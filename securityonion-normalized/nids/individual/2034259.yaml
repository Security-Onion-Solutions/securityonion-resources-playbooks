name: ET EXPLOIT Apache Solr RCE via Velocity Template M2 (CVE-2019-17558)
id: 1211497
description: |
  Detects GET requests to Solr's /select endpoint containing Velocity template parameters that could enable remote code execution.
  May trigger on legitimate Solr administration or custom template usage in development environments.
