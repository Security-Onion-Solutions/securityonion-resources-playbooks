name: ET MALWARE Trojan-Dropper.MSIL CnC Traffic - GET
id: 1214742
description: |
  Detects HTTP GET requests with specific URI patterns and missing common headers that may indicate MSIL trojan-dropper command and control communication.
  Legitimate applications may also exhibit similar patterns when downloading files or using simplified HTTP clients.
