name: ET HUNTING Possible UPnP UUID Overflow Exploit Attempt from External Host - SUBSCRIBE/UNSUBSCRIBE
id: 1226450
description: |
  Detects HTTP SUBSCRIBE/UNSUBSCRIBE requests with unusually long UUID headers that may indicate buffer overflow attempts.
  May trigger on legitimate UPnP clients with verbose UUID formats or network scanning tools.
