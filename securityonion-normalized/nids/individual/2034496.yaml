name: ET HUNTING Possible UPnP UUID Overflow Exploit Attempt from Internal Host - SUBSCRIBE/UNSUBSCRIBE
id: 1226491
description: |
  Detects HTTP SUBSCRIBE/UNSUBSCRIBE requests with unusually long UUID headers that may indicate UPnP buffer overflow attempts.
  May trigger on legitimate UPnP services or devices with valid long UUIDs.
