name: ET HUNTING Possible Apache log4j RCE Attempt - Any Protocol (lower UDP Bypass) (Outbound) (CVE-2021-44228)
id: 1229307
description: |
  Detects UDP traffic containing JNDI strings with "lower" function that may indicate Log4j exploitation attempts bypassing case-sensitive filters.
  May trigger on legitimate Java applications using JNDI lookups or network protocols that coincidentally contain these patterns.
