name: ET EXPLOIT Possible Apache log4j RCE Attempt - 2021/12/13 Obfuscation Observed (tcp) (Outbound) (CVE-2021-44228)
id: 1212645
description: |
  Detects obfuscated JNDI strings in TCP traffic that match Log4j RCE exploitation patterns with environment variable references.
  May trigger on legitimate Java applications using complex JNDI lookups or security testing tools.
