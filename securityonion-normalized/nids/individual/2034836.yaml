name: ET EXPLOIT Apache log4j RCE Attempt - 2021/12/13 Obfuscation Observed (tcp) (Outbound) (CVE-2021-44228)
id: 1242742
description: |
  Detects obfuscated JNDI strings in TCP traffic that match Log4j RCE exploitation patterns using various encoding techniques.
  May trigger on legitimate Java applications using JNDI lookups or security scanning tools testing for Log4j vulnerabilities.
