name: ET MALWARE PurpleFox Backdoor/Rootkit Download Request M1
id: 1218691
description: |
  Detects HTTP requests matching PurpleFox backdoor/rootkit download patterns with specific URI parameters and header structures.
  Legitimate applications may generate similar numeric patterns, but the combination of specific URI format and header sequence is highly suspicious.
