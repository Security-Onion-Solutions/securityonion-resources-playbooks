name: ET ATTACK_RESPONSE Possible ELEFANTE/ElephantBeetle Enumeration Activity M2
id: 1200018
description: |
  Detects HTTP GET requests with specific parameter patterns (host, port, request with GET and whoami hex values) associated with ElephantBeetle/ELEFANTE toolkit enumeration activities.
  May trigger on legitimate network scanning tools or applications using similar parameter structures.
