name: ET EXPLOIT Zerologon Phase 2/3 - NetrServerAuthenticate2 Request with 0x00 Client Challenge and Sign and Seal Disabled (CVE-2020-1472) M2
id: 1212609
description: |
  Detects Phase 2 of Zerologon exploitation where NetrServerAuthenticate2 requests use null client challenges with disabled signing and sealing.
  May occur during legitimate domain controller communication or network diagnostics, but often indicates CVE-2020-1472 exploitation attempts.
