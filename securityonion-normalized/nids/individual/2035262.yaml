name: ET EXPLOIT Zerologon Phase 3/3 - Malicious NetrServerPasswordSet2 (CVE-2020-1472)
id: 1212447
description: |
  Detects the final phase of Zerologon exploitation where attackers use NetrServerPasswordSet2 RPC calls with null credentials to reset domain controller computer account passwords. This represents active exploitation of CVE-2020-1472 after successful authentication bypass. May trigger during legitimate domain controller maintenance or password reset operations.
