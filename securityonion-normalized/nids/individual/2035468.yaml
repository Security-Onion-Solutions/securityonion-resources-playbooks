name: ET MALWARE Observed TA471/UNC2589 Go Downloader User-Agent (-hobot-)
id: 1232512
description: |
  Detects HTTP connections using the distinctive "-hobot-" user-agent string associated with TA471/UNC2589 Go downloader malware.
  This user-agent pattern is highly specific to this threat actor's toolset and is unlikely to appear in legitimate applications.
