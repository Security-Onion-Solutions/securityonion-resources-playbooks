name: ET MALWARE Lyceum Golang HTTP Backdoor Connectivity Check
id: 1236024
description: |
  Detects HTTP POST requests to "/GO/*.php" endpoints with specific header patterns consistent with Lyceum APT group's Golang backdoor.
  May trigger on legitimate applications using similar URI patterns or testing tools mimicking this communication.
