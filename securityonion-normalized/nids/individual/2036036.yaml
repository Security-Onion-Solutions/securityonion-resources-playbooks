name: ET DYN_DNS DYNAMIC_DNS Query to a *.myz.info Domain
id: 1226794
description: |
  Detects DNS queries to domains ending in .myz.info, which is a dynamic DNS service that can be used for legitimate remote access or C2 communications.
  May indicate normal use of dynamic DNS services for home networks, remote access, or potentially malicious command and control infrastructure.
