name: ET WEB_SERVER Possible SSRF Attempt Inbound Using Common Dork M14
id: 1245956
description: |
  Detects HTTP requests containing validate parameters with URL or IP patterns that may indicate Server-Side Request Forgery (SSRF) attempts.
  May trigger on legitimate applications that validate URLs or perform security testing with SSRF detection tools.
