name: ET INFO Possible JARM Fingerprinting Client Hello via tls1_3_middle_out
id: 1213624
description: |
  Detects TLS Client Hello packets with specific cipher suites and ALPN values that match JARM fingerprinting tools.
  May trigger on legitimate security scanning, research tools, or applications using similar TLS configurations.
