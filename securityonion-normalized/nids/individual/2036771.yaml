name: ET MALWARE Sidewinder APT Related Domain in DNS Lookup (nrots .net)
id: 1235526
description: |
  Detects DNS queries to domains ending in .nrots.net, which have been associated with Sidewinder APT operations.
  May trigger on legitimate traffic if organizations use similar domain naming patterns or during security research activities.
