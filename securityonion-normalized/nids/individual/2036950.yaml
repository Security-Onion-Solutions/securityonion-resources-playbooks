name: ET MALWARE Symbiote CnC Domain in DNS Lookup (assets .fans)
id: 1235589
description: |
  Detects DNS queries for domains ending in .assets.fans, associated with Symbiote malware command and control infrastructure.
  This pattern could trigger on legitimate domains using the same TLD, though .assets.fans is primarily associated with malicious infrastructure.
