name: ET ATTACK_RESPONSE Havoc/Sliver Framework TLS Certificate Observed
id: 1204697
description: |
  Detects TLS certificates matching the Havoc/Sliver post-exploitation framework pattern.
  These certificates use specific subject fields (US, Arizona, Chandler, Synergy) that indicate
  C2 infrastructure. May rarely trigger on legitimate certificates with similar attributes.
