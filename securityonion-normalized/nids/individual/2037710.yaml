name: ET MALWARE Observed Malicious SSL Cert (Microsoft Security localhost)
id: 1215073
description: |
  Detects SSL/TLS connections using a specific certificate with subject "C=US, ST=California, O=Microsoft, OU=Security, CN=localhost".
  This certificate pattern has been observed in Brute Ratel C4 command and control communications.
  May trigger on legitimate testing environments or applications using similar certificate patterns.
