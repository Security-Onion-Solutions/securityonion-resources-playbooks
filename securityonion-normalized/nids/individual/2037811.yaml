name: ET MALWARE Downloaded .PNG With Embedded File (.sh)
id: 1218052
description: |
  Detects PNG image downloads that contain embedded shell script files. This technique
  hides malicious shell scripts within legitimate-looking image files for steganographic delivery.
  May trigger on legitimate PNG files that contain binary data patterns resembling shell headers.
