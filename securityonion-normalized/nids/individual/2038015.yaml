name: ET HUNTING HTTP GET Request XOR Key 33
id: 1223876
description: |
  Detects HTTP GET requests containing XOR-encoded content with key 33, which may indicate
  obfuscated communications or data exfiltration. Could also trigger on legitimate applications
  using XOR encoding for data protection or custom protocols.
