name: ET HUNTING HTTP GET Request XOR Key 3a
id: 1223823
description: |
  Detects HTTP GET requests containing XOR-encoded content with key 0x3a, which may indicate obfuscated malware communications or encrypted C2 traffic.
  May also trigger on legitimate applications using XOR encoding for data protection or compression.
