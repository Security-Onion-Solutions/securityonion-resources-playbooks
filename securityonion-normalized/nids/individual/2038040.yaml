name: ET HUNTING HTTP GET Request XOR Key 4c
id: 1223937
description: |
  Detects HTTP GET requests containing XOR-encoded content with key 4c (hex). This pattern may indicate obfuscated communication or data exfiltration attempts, but can also occur in legitimate applications using XOR encoding for data protection or compression.
