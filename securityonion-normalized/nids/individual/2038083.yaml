name: ET HUNTING HTTP GET Request XOR Key 77
id: 1223870
description: |
  Detects HTTP GET requests containing XOR-encoded content with key 77, which may indicate obfuscated command and control communications or data exfiltration attempts.
  May also trigger on legitimate applications using XOR encoding for data protection or compression.
