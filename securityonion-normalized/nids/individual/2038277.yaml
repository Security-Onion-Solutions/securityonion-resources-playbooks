name: ET HUNTING HTTP POST Request XOR Key 3b
id: 1203162
description: |
  Detects HTTP POST requests containing XOR-encoded content with key 0x3b, which may indicate
  obfuscated communications or data exfiltration attempts. Could also trigger on legitimate
  applications using XOR encoding for data protection or compression.
