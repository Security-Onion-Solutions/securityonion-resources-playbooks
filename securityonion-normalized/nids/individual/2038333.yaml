name: ET HUNTING HTTP POST Request XOR Key 73
id: 1223786
description: |
  Detects HTTP POST requests containing XOR-encoded data using key 73, which may indicate data obfuscation or evasion techniques.
  Could also trigger on legitimate applications using XOR encoding for data protection or custom protocols.
