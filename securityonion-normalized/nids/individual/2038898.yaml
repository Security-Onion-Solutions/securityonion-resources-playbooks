name: ET MALWARE Golang/Webbfustator DNS Tunneling Activity
id: 1235761
description: |
  Detects DNS queries starting with "ReplaceWithRandom." which indicates Golang/Webbfustator malware using DNS tunneling for command and control communication.
  May trigger on legitimate applications using similar domain patterns or DNS testing tools.
