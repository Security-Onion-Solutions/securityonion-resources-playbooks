name: ET DYN_DNS DYNAMIC_DNS Query to a *.cylone .net Domain
id: 1204087
description: |
  Detects DNS queries to cylone.net domains, which are dynamic DNS services that can be used for legitimate remote access or command and control communications.
  May trigger on legitimate users accessing services hosted on dynamic DNS providers.
