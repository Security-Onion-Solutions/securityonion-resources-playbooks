name: ET DYN_DNS DYNAMIC_DNS HTTP Request to a *.nethub.fi Domain
id: 1211012
description: |
  Detects HTTP requests to nethub.fi dynamic DNS domains. While this service can be used for legitimate hosting,
  it is also commonly used by malware for command and control infrastructure due to its free availability.
