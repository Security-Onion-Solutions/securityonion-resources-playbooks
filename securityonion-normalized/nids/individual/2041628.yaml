name: ET DYN_DNS DYNAMIC_DNS Query to a *.novohorizonte.pt Domain
id: 1217856
description: |
  Detects DNS queries to *.novohorizonte.pt domain, which is a dynamic DNS service that can be used for legitimate hosting or command and control communications.
  This may indicate normal dynamic DNS usage or potential C2 communications through DNS tunneling.
