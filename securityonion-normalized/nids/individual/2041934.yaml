name: ET DYN_DNS DYNAMIC_DNS Query to a *.24-7.ro Domain
id: 1230325
description: |
  Detects DNS queries to 24-7.ro dynamic DNS domains. While these domains can be used for legitimate purposes like hosting personal websites or services, they are also commonly used by malware for command and control infrastructure due to their free registration and dynamic IP capabilities.
