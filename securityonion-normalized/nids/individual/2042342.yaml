name: ET DYN_DNS DYNAMIC_DNS Query to a *.from-mi.com Domain
id: 1230535
description: |
  Detects DNS queries to from-mi.com dynamic DNS domains. May indicate C2 communications
  using dynamic DNS services, but could also represent legitimate use of dynamic DNS for
  remote access or hosting services.
