name: ET DYN_DNS DYNAMIC_DNS Query to a *.mine.nu Domain
id: 1230628
description: |
  Detects DNS queries to mine.nu dynamic DNS domains. While these services have legitimate uses,
  they are frequently used by malware for command and control infrastructure due to their free
  registration and ability to quickly change IP addresses.
