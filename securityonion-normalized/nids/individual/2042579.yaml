name: ET DYN_DNS DYNAMIC_DNS Query to a *.is-saved.org Domain
id: 1202998
description: |
  Detects DNS queries to *.is-saved.org dynamic DNS domains, which may indicate legitimate remote access setup or command and control communications.
  Dynamic DNS services are commonly used by both legitimate remote workers and malicious actors for persistent access.
