name: ET DYN_DNS DYNAMIC_DNS Query to a *.ddns.mobi Domain
id: 1224862
description: |
  Detects DNS queries to dynamic DNS domains ending in .ddns.mobi. These domains
  can be used for legitimate remote access or monitoring, but may also indicate
  command and control infrastructure or data exfiltration channels.
