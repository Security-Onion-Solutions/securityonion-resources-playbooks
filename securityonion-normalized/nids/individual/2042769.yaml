name: ET MALWARE PSRansom File Exfiltration (POST)
id: 1233120
description: |
  Detects HTTP POST requests to "/files/" endpoints with specific PowerShell user-agent patterns and base64-encoded payloads that match PSRansom file exfiltration behavior.
  May trigger on legitimate PowerShell scripts performing file uploads or other applications using similar patterns.
