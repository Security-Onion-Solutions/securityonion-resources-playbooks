  - question: What IP addresses did the dynip.org domain resolve to?
    context: Reveals the current IP address associated with the dynamic DNS hostname.
    range: +/-15m
    query: "aggregation: false\nlogsource:\n  category: network\n  service: dns\ndetection:\n  selection:\n    community_id: '{network.community_id}'\n    dns.resolved_ip|exists: true\n  condition: selection\nfields:\n  - dns.query.name\n  - dns.resolved_ip\n  - dns.query.type_name\n  \n"
