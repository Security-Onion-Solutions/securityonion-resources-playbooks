name: ET DYN_DNS DYNAMIC_DNS Query to a *.now-dns.top Domain
id: 1216990
description: |
  Detects DNS queries to now-dns.top dynamic DNS domains. These services are commonly used by
  malware for command and control infrastructure, but may also be used by legitimate applications
  requiring dynamic hostname resolution.
