name: ET INFO Observed DNS over HTTPS Domain in TLS SNI (n .3363 .net)
id: 1213592
description: |
  Detects TLS connections to domains ending with .n.3363.net which may indicate DNS over HTTPS usage.
  Could represent legitimate privacy-focused DNS resolution or potential protocol tunneling for C2 communication.
