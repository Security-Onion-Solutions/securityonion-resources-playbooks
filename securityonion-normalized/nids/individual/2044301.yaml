name: ET HUNTING HTTP GET Request for sqlite3.dll - Possible Infostealer Activity
id: 1215877
description: |
  Detects HTTP GET requests for sqlite3.dll file. This pattern is commonly observed in infostealer malware that downloads database libraries to access browser credentials and stored data. May also trigger on legitimate software installations or updates that require SQLite components.
