name: ET DYN_DNS DYNAMIC_DNS Query to a *.ireland.mx Domain
id: 1225068
description: |
  Detects DNS queries to .ireland.mx subdomains, which is a free dynamic DNS service.
  These domains can be used for legitimate hosting but are also commonly abused for command and control infrastructure due to their free registration and dynamic IP capabilities.
