name: ET MALWARE Prometei Botnet CnC DGA - xinchao Pattern
id: 1232689
description: |
  Detects DNS queries to domains starting with "xinchao" followed by hexadecimal patterns,
  indicating communication with Prometei botnet command and control infrastructure.
  May trigger on legitimate domains containing these patterns or security research activities.
