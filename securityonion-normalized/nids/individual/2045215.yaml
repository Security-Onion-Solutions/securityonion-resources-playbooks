name: ET MALWARE TitanStealer Data Exfiltration Attempt
id: 1218903
description: |
  Detects HTTP POST requests to "/sendlog" endpoint with Base64-encoded data matching TitanStealer information stealing malware patterns.
  May trigger on legitimate applications that use similar logging endpoints or Base64 encoding.
