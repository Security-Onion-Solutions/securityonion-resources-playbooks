name: ET RETIRED IIS-Raid Module Backdoor Default Headers in HTTP Request
id: 1202336
description: |
  Detects HTTP requests containing specific header combinations (x-chrome-variations and x-password) associated with IIS-Raid backdoor modules.
  May trigger on legitimate applications using similar custom headers or security testing tools.
