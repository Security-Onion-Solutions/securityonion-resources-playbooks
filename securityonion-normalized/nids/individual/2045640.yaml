name: ET MALWARE FSB Snake CnC Activity Inbound via TCP (AA23-129A) M1
id: 1242092
description: |
  Detects inbound TCP traffic matching FSB Snake malware command and control communication patterns.
  This specific signature identifies a stage in the Snake malware's multi-stage C2 protocol handshake.
  May rarely trigger on protocols using similar 8-byte headers with null padding.
