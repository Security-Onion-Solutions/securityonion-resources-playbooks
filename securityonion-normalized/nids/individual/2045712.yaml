name: ET DYN_DNS DYNAMIC_DNS Query to a *.4rp.es Domain
id: 1225115
description: |
  Detects DNS queries to *.4rp.es domains, which are dynamic DNS services that can be used for legitimate hosting or command and control communications.
  May trigger on legitimate use of free DNS hosting services or penetration testing activities.
