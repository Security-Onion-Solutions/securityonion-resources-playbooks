name: ET MALWARE TA427 Related Domain in DNS Lookup (com-def .asia)
id: 1256442
description: |
  Detects DNS queries for domains under com-def.asia infrastructure associated with TA427 threat group.
  This domain pattern has been linked to targeted espionage campaigns, though may also trigger on legitimate traffic to compromised or typosquatted domains.
