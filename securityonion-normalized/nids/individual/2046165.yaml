name: ET SCADA IEC-104 Clock Synchronization Command
id: 1217246
description: |
  Detects IEC-104 clock synchronization commands used in SCADA systems for time coordination.
  This is normal protocol behavior in industrial control systems but may indicate unauthorized access to critical infrastructure.
