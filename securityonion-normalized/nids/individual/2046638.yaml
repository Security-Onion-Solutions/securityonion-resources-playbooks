name: ET PHISHING Suspicious IPFS Domain Rewritten with Google Translate
id: 1216492
description: |
  Detects DNS queries for domains combining IPFS (InterPlanetary File System) with Google Translate domains.
  May indicate phishing campaigns using decentralized hosting with translation services to evade detection,
  but could also trigger on legitimate research or testing of IPFS content through translation services.
