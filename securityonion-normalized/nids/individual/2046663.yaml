name: ET MALWARE [ANY.RUN] Gh0stBins Kernel Download Request
id: 1236193
description: |
  Detects network traffic containing the "KNELBINS" signature followed by null bytes, characteristic of Gh0stBins RAT kernel component downloads.
  May trigger on legitimate software with similar binary patterns or network protocols using comparable data structures.
