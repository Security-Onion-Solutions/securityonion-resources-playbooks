name: ET INFO External IP Address Lookup Service in DNS Lookup (getip .pro)
id: 1204684
description: |
  Detects DNS queries to getip.pro, a service that reveals the external IP address of the querying host.
  May indicate legitimate network diagnostics or applications checking their external IP, but could also suggest malware establishing C2 communications.
