name: ET MALWARE MacOS/Adload CnC Beacon
id: 1215258
description: |
  Detects HTTP POST requests to "/a/rep" endpoints with specific user-agent patterns and request body characteristics consistent with macOS Adload malware command and control communications.
  May trigger on legitimate applications using similar HTTP patterns or network testing tools.
