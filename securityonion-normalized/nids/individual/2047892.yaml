name: ET EXPLOIT_KIT ClearFake Domain in TLS SNI (pwwqkppwqkezqer .site)
id: 1242815
description: |
  Detects TLS connections to a specific ClearFake exploit kit domain. ClearFake typically operates through compromised websites that redirect users to fake browser update pages. May trigger on legitimate traffic if the domain is repurposed.
