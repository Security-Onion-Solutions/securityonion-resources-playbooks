name: ET EXPLOIT_KIT TOAD Domain in DNS Lookup (mta-sts .gub .bio)
id: 1244254
description: |
  Detects DNS queries for domains ending with .mta-sts.gub.bio associated with TOAD exploit kit campaigns.
  May occasionally trigger on legitimate MTA-STS policy lookups if .gub.bio is used for legitimate services.
