name: ET EXPLOIT_KIT DNS Query to TOAD Domain (suvfix .us)
id: 1244350
description: |
  Detects DNS queries to domains ending with .suvfix.us, which are associated with TOAD exploit kit infrastructure.
  May trigger on legitimate DNS queries if domains are repurposed or on security research activities.
