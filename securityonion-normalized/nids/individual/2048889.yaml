name: ET EXPLOIT_KIT Observed TOAD Domain (hshelp .info in TLS SNI)
id: 1244113
description: |
  Detects TLS connections to domains ending with .hshelp.info, which are associated with TOAD exploit kit infrastructure.
  May trigger on legitimate access to these domains if they are used for non-malicious purposes.
