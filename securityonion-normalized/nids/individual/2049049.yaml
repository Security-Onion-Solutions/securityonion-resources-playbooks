name: ET INFO Observed DNS Query to *.ngrok Domain (ngrok-free .dev)
id: 1214025
description: |
  Detects DNS queries to ngrok-free.dev subdomains. Ngrok is a legitimate tunneling service
  that creates secure tunnels to localhost, commonly used for development and testing.
  May indicate authorized remote access, development activities, or unauthorized tunneling.
