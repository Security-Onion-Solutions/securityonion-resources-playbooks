name: ET HUNTING Suspicious HTTP Server Value in Response (Apache Coyote)
id: 1200240
description: |
  Detects HTTP responses with "Apache Coyote" server headers, which may indicate servers impersonating legitimate Apache installations.
  Could represent legitimate Tomcat servers or threat actors using common server names to blend in.
