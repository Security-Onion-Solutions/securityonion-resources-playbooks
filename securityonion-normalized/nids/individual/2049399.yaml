name: ET MALWARE WebDAV Retrieving .vbs from .url M2 (CVE-2023-36025)
id: 1218502
description: |
  Detects HTTP responses containing Internet Shortcut (.url) files that reference VBScript files (.vbs).
  This pattern indicates exploitation of CVE-2023-36025, a Windows vulnerability allowing remote code execution through malicious .url files.
  May trigger on legitimate applications that use Internet Shortcuts or automated security testing tools.
