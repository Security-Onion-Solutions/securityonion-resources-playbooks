name: ET EXPLOIT_KIT Fake WordPress CVE Plugin Domain in TLS SNI (wpops .zip)
id: 1242998
description: |
  Detects TLS connections to domains containing "wpops.zip" in the Server Name Indication (SNI).
  This pattern is associated with exploit kit activity masquerading as WordPress CVE plugins.
  May trigger on legitimate domains or security research activities.
