name: ET MALWARE Observed UAC-0177 Domain (authssl .site in TLS SNI)
id: 1256934
description: |
  Detects TLS connections to domains ending in .authssl.site, associated with UAC-0177 threat actor infrastructure.
  May trigger on legitimate connections if the domain is repurposed or in testing environments.
