name: ET MALWARE Observed UAC-0177 Domain (passport2.zip in TLS SNI)
id: 1256938
description: |
  Detects TLS connections to domains ending with "passport2.zip" associated with UAC-0177 campaign.
  This pattern is highly specific to this threat actor's infrastructure and unlikely to trigger on legitimate traffic.
