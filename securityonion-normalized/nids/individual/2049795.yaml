name: ET SCADA Rockwell RNA Message Large Header Length - 8Kb
id: 1224300
description: |
  Detects Rockwell RNA protocol messages with unusually large header lengths (>8KB) that may indicate buffer overflow attempts or denial of service attacks against industrial control systems.
  Large headers could represent legitimate bulk data transfers or configuration updates in industrial environments.
