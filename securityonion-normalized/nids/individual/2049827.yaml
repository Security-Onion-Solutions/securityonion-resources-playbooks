name: ET EXPLOIT_KIT TA569 Keitaro TDS Domain in TLS SNI (confirmapply .org)
id: 1243065
description: |
  Detects TLS connections to confirmapply.org domain, which is associated with TA569 Keitaro Traffic Direction System (TDS).
  May indicate malware redirecting traffic through compromised infrastructure, though could also be legitimate access to this domain.
