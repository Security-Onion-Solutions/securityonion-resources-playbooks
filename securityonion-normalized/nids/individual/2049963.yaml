name: ET MALWARE Suspected TA451 Related FalseFont Backdoor Activity M3
id: 1241043
description: |
  Detects HTTP POST requests to /api/Token with specific JSON payload structure containing username, password, computerHostName, and osName fields that match FalseFont backdoor communication patterns.
