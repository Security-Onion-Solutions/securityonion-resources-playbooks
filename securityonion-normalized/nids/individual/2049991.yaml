name: ET RETIRED Blister Loader Cobalt Strike C2 Profile M17
id: 1207904
description: |
  Detects HTTP requests to URIs starting with "/apply/admin_/" followed by alphanumeric patterns consistent with Cobalt Strike C2 communications using the M17 profile through Blister loader.
  May trigger on legitimate applications using similar URI patterns or administrative interfaces.
