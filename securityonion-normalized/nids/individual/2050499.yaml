name: ET WEB_SPECIFIC_APPS Apache Kafka UI Unsanitized Groovy Script Filter Remote Code Execution Attempt (CVE-2023-52251)
id: 1209264
description: |
  Detects HTTP GET requests to Apache Kafka UI endpoints containing Groovy script filter parameters that may indicate CVE-2023-52251 exploitation attempts.
  May trigger on legitimate administrative access to Kafka UI with custom filtering or security testing activities.
