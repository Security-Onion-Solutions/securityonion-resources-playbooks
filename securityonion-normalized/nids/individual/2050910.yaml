name: ET MALWARE Observed TinyTurla Domain (caduff-sa.ch in TLS SNI)
id: 1241085
description: |
  Detects TLS connections to caduff-sa.ch domain associated with TinyTurla malware C2 infrastructure.
  May trigger on legitimate access to this domain, though the association with TinyTurla makes this unlikely.
