name: ET MALWARE Goldoon Botnet Payload Retrieval Attempt
id: 1234176
description: |
  Detects HTTP requests to retrieve Goldoon botnet payloads from the /bins/ directory
  with the distinctive "FBI-Agent (Checking You)" user agent. This specific pattern
  indicates malware payload retrieval rather than legitimate security scanning.
