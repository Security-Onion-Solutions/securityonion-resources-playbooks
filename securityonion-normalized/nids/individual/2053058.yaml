name: ET DYN_DNS DYNAMIC_DNS Query to a *.cdpa.cc Domain
id: 1225258
description: |
  Detects DNS queries to *.cdpa.cc domains, which are free dynamic DNS services.
  These domains are commonly used for legitimate dynamic DNS but may also be used
  for command and control infrastructure or to bypass domain reputation filters.
