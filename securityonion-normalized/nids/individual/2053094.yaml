name: ET DYN_DNS DYNAMIC_DNS Query to a *.ilja.org Domain
id: 1217107
description: |
  Detects DNS queries to domains ending in .ilja.org, which are associated with a dynamic DNS service.
  May indicate legitimate use of dynamic DNS for remote access or could suggest command and control communication.
