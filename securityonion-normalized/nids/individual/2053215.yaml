name: ET MALWARE SocGholish CnC Domain in TLS SNI (*.patent.international-med.com)
id: 1250475
description: |
  Detects TLS connections to domains ending in .patent.international-med.com associated with SocGholish malware C2 infrastructure.
  May trigger on legitimate access if these domains are repurposed, though this is unlikely given the suspicious naming pattern.
