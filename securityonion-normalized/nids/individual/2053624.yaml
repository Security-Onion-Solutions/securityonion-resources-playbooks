name: ET INFO Observed DNS over HTTPS Domain (doh .iucc .ac .il in TLS SNI)
id: 1204953
description: |
  Detects TLS connections to DNS over HTTPS (DoH) servers at the Israeli Inter-University Computation Center.
  This is often legitimate DNS privacy enhancement but may indicate attempts to bypass DNS monitoring.
