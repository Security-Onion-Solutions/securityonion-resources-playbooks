name: ET MALWARE Observed Malicious Typo Squatting Domain (puttyy .org) in TLS SNI
id: 1234576
description: |
  Detects TLS connections to puttyy.org, a typo-squatting domain mimicking the legitimate PuTTY SSH client website.
  May trigger on legitimate access if users mistype the domain or if the domain has been legitimately registered.
