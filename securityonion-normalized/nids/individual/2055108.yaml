name: ET MALWARE TA399 SideWinder APT CnC Domain in DNS Lookup (msacn .ntcpk .net)
id: 1250871
description: |
  Detects DNS queries for domains using the .msacn.ntcpk.net pattern associated with SideWinder APT group (TA399).
  This domain pattern has been observed in targeted campaigns. Legitimate applications would not typically query these domains.
