name: ET EXPLOIT_KIT ZPHP Domain in TLS SNI (utvj.com)
id: 1243428
description: |
  Detects TLS connections to utvj.com domain, which is associated with ZPHP exploit kit activity.
  This domain may be used for fake browser update campaigns and drive-by compromise attacks.
  Could also trigger on legitimate access if the domain is later repurposed for benign use.
