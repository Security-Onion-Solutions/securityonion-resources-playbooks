name: ET MALWARE Observed DNS Query to Rogue RDP (UAC-0215) Domain (s3-ned .cloud)
id: 1236639
description: |
  Detects DNS queries to s3-ned.cloud domains associated with UAC-0215 threat actor's rogue RDP infrastructure.
  May trigger on legitimate DNS queries if domain is hijacked or used for legitimate purposes.
