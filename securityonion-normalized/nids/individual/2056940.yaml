name: ET MALWARE Observed Rogue RDP (UAC-0215) Domain (mzv-gov .cloud in TLS SNI)
id: 1236674
description: |
  Detects TLS connections to domains ending with .mzv-gov.cloud associated with UAC-0215 campaign.
  Legitimate connections to this domain are unlikely as it appears to be a typosquatting domain.
