name: ET MALWARE Observed Rogue RDP (UAC-0215) Domain in TLS SNI
id: 1236675
description: |
  Detects TLS connections to domains matching UAC-0215 campaign infrastructure using the pattern eu-southeast-1-aws.zero-trust.solutions.
  May trigger on legitimate zero-trust solutions but this specific subdomain pattern is associated with malicious infrastructure.
