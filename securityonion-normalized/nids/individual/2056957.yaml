name: ET MALWARE Observed Rogue RDP (UAC-0215) Domain (s3-ua .cloud in TLS SNI)
id: 1236686
description: |
  Detects TLS connections to domains ending in .s3-ua.cloud, associated with UAC-0215 (Ghostwriter/UNC1151) threat group.
  This domain pattern has been linked to command and control infrastructure for rogue RDP operations targeting Ukrainian entities.
