name: ET MALWARE Observed Rogue RDP (UAC-0215) Domain
id: 1219712
description: |
  Detects TLS connections to domains matching UAC-0215 (APT group) infrastructure pattern using .eu-south-1-aws.mfa-gov.cloud domains.
  These domains impersonate legitimate AWS and government services for command and control communications.
