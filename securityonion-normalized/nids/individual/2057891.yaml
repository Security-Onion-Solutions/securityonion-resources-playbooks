name: ET HUNTING Possible Host Profile Exfiltration on High TCP Port
id: 1210784
description: |
  Detects outbound traffic containing Windows system profile information including OS version, edition, user, and domain details on high TCP ports.
  May trigger on legitimate system inventory tools, backup software, or administrative scripts that collect host information.
