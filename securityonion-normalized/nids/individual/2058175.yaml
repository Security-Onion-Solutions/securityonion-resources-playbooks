name: ET HUNTING TryCloudFlare Domain in TLS SNI
id: 1230644
description: |
  Detects TLS connections to trycloudflare.com domains, which can be used for legitimate tunneling but also commonly abused by threat actors for C2 communications.
  TryCloudflare provides temporary public URLs for local services and may indicate unauthorized tunneling or malware C2 activity.
