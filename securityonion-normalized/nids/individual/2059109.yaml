name: ET INFO SMBv2 Protocol Ioctl Operation Observed
id: 1257792
description: |
  Detects SMBv2 protocol IOCTL operations which are used for device control and communication.
  These operations are part of normal SMB functionality but may also be used in lateral movement or reconnaissance activities.
