name: ET MALWARE SocGholish CnC Domain in TLS SNI (webmail .ebuildingsource .com)
id: 1237854
description: |
  Detects TLS connections to a known SocGholish command and control domain. SocGholish is a JavaScript framework used to deliver additional malware payloads. This specific domain pattern has been observed in SocGholish campaigns targeting organizations through fake browser update prompts and other social engineering techniques.
