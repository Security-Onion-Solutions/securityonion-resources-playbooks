name: ET MALWARE implant.js CnC Activity (Evil DBG_CMD_* Sent)
id: 1230943
description: |
  Detects command and control activity from implant.js malware where debug commands are sent from the C2 server to the infected client.
  The specific byte patterns indicate malicious command sequences unlikely to occur in normal network traffic.
