name: ET PHISHING TA453 Domain in TLS SNI
id: 1210553
description: |
  Detects TLS connections to domains ending in ".accent-going-session.bond" associated with TA453 phishing campaigns.
  May indicate credential theft attempts or phishing infrastructure. Could trigger on legitimate connections if domain is repurposed.
