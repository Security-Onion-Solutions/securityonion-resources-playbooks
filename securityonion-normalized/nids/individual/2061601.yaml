name: ET MALWARE PureLogs GZIP Exfiltration Outbound
id: 1218920
description: |
  Detects outbound connections to TCP port 5555 containing GZIP-compressed data, indicating potential PureLogs malware data exfiltration.
  May trigger on legitimate applications using GZIP compression over non-standard ports or file transfer utilities.
