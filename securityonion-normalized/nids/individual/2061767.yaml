name: ET EXPLOIT Belkin N750 Buffer Overflow Attempt
id: 1212663
description: |
  Detects POST requests to /login.cgi with oversized data that may indicate buffer overflow exploitation attempts against Belkin N750 routers.
  May trigger on legitimate authentication attempts with unusual parameters or security testing tools.
