name: ET EXPLOIT SSH Client Key Exchange Init Cookie Null
id: 1203766
description: |
  Detects SSH connections with null cookie values in client key exchange initialization that may indicate CVE-2025-32433 exploitation attempts against Erlang OTP servers.
  May trigger on legitimate SSH implementations with unusual key exchange patterns or network issues affecting SSH handshakes.
