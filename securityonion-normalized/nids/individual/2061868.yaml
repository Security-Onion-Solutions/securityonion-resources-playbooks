name: ET MALWARE Observed DNS Query to ClickFix Related Inject Domain (signature908 .golf)
id: 1231598
description: |
  Detects DNS queries to ClickFix malware infrastructure using signature908.golf domains.
  ClickFix campaigns use fake error pages to trick users into copying malicious PowerShell commands.
  May trigger on legitimate .golf domain usage or security research activities.
