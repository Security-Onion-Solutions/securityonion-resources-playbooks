name: ET WEB_SPECIFIC_APPS Totolink BufferOverflow Attempt formWsc localPin Parameter Buffer Overflow Attempt
id: 1223163
description: |
  Detects POST requests to /boafrm/formWsc with oversized localPin parameter values that may indicate buffer overflow exploitation attempts against Totolink devices.
  May trigger on legitimate configuration attempts with unusually long PIN values or security testing activities.
