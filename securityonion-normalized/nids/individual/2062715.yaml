name: ET INFO Observed UA-CPU Header
id: 1205495
description: |
  Detects HTTP requests containing the UA-CPU header, which was historically used by Internet Explorer to specify processor architecture.
  May indicate legitimate legacy browser usage or potentially suspicious user-agent spoofing attempts.
