name: ET DYN_DNS DYNAMIC_DNS Query to a *.c-om.net domain
id: 1211437
description: |
  Detects DNS queries to domains ending in .c-om.net, a pattern associated with dynamic DNS services.
  May trigger on legitimate applications using dynamic DNS for connectivity or security tools performing reconnaissance.
