name: GPL POP3 x86 BSD overflow 2
id: 1248806
description: |
  Detects specific byte sequences in POP3 traffic that may indicate exploitation attempts targeting x86 BSD systems.
  May trigger on legitimate POP3 traffic containing similar binary patterns or email attachments with matching byte sequences.
