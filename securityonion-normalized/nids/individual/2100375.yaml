questions:
  - question: What was the complete ICMP packet that triggered this alert?
    context: Reveals the exact ping characteristics and payload details.

  - question: Does this host normally receive ICMP pings from external sources?
    context: Determines if this represents a change from normal network patterns.

  - question: What other network activity occurred from this external source?
    context: Identifies additional reconnaissance or connection attempts from the same source.
