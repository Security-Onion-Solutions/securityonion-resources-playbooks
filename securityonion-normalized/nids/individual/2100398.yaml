name: GPL ICMP Destination Unreachable Host Unreachable for Type of Service
id: 1248559
description: |
  Detects ICMP Type 3 Code 12 messages indicating host unreachable for specific type of service.
  This is typically network infrastructure responding to routing or QoS issues, but may indicate network reconnaissance or filtering.
