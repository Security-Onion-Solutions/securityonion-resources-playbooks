name: GPL NETBIOS SMB IPC$ share access
id: 1227616
description: |
  Detects SMB access to the IPC$ administrative share, commonly used for inter-process communication.
  Legitimate uses include domain authentication, service enumeration, and administrative tools.
  May indicate reconnaissance, lateral movement attempts, or normal Windows domain operations.
