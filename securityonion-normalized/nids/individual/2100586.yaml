questions:
  - question: What was the complete RPC portmap request packet that triggered this alert?
    context: Reveals the full RPC request structure and parameters for analysis.
    range: +/-15m
    query: "aggregation: false\nlogsource:\n  category: network\n  service: \ndetection:\n  selection:\n    community_id: '{network.community_id}'\n  condition: selection\nfields:\n  - src_ip\n  - dst_ip\n  - dst_port"
  - question: Does this external host normally perform RPC queries against internal systems?
    context: Determines if RPC portmap access from this source is typical behavior.

  - question: What RPC services are running on the target host?
    context: Identifies what RPC services may be exposed through the portmap service.
    range: +/-15m
    query: "aggregation: false\nlogsource:\n  category: network\n  service: connection\ndetection:\n  selection:\n    dst_ip: '{destination.ip}'\n    dst_port: [111, 135, 2049, 4045]\n  condition: selection\nfields:\n  - src_ip\n  - dst_port\n  - network.protocol\n  - connection.state\n  \n"
  - question: What other RPC-related connections occurred from this external host?
    context: Identifies additional RPC service interactions that may indicate scanning.

  - question: Are multiple external hosts querying RPC portmap services?
    context: Determines if this is part of broader RPC service discovery or scanning activity.

  - question: Did the target host respond with RPC service information?
    context: Assesses whether the portmap query was successful in enumerating services.
    range: +5m
    query: "aggregation: false\nlogsource:\n  category: network\n  service: connection\ndetection:\n  selection:\n    src_ip: '{destination.ip}'\n    dst_ip: '{source.ip}'\n    src_port: 111\n  condition: selection\nfields:\n  - connection.state\n  - network.bytes_toserver\n  - network.bytes_toclient\n  \n"
  - question: What other network services are accessible on the target host?
    context: Identifies additional services that may be exposed alongside RPC portmap.
