name: GPL EXPLOIT Unicode Directory Traversal Attempt
id: 1225830
description: |
  Detects HTTP requests containing Unicode-encoded directory traversal sequences that bypass basic path validation.
  May trigger on legitimate applications that use Unicode encoding or security scanning tools testing for vulnerabilities.
