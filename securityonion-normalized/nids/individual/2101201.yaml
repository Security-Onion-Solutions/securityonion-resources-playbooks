questions:
  - question: What was the complete HTTP request that resulted in the 403 Forbidden response?
    context: Understanding the full request reveals what resource access was denied.
    range: +/-15m
    query: |
      aggregation: false
      logsource:
        category: network
        service: http

        selection:
          community_id: '{network.community_id}'
        condition: selection
      fields:
        - http.method
        - http.useragent
        - http.virtual_host
        - http.uri
        - http.status_code
  - question: Does this external client normally access this web server?
    context: Determines if this represents a change from normal client access patterns.

          dst_ip: '{destination.ip}'
        condition: selection
      fields:
        - dst_ip
  - question: What is the pattern of HTTP status codes returned to this client?
    context: Identifies if the client is receiving consistent access denials or mixed responses.
    range: +/-30m
    query: "aggregation: false\nlogsource:\n  category: network\n  service: http\ndetection:\n  selection:\n    src_ip: '{destination.ip}'\n    dst_ip: '{source.ip}'\n  condition: selection\nfields:\n  - http.status_code\n  - http.uri\n  - http.method\n  - http.user_agent\n  \n"
  - question: What other HTTP resources is this client attempting to access?
    context: Reveals if the client is conducting directory enumeration or scanning.
    range: +/-2h
    query: "aggregation: false\nlogsource:\n  category: network\n  service: http\ndetection:\n  selection:\n    src_ip: '{destination.ip}'\n    dst_ip: '{source.ip}'\n  condition: selection\nfields:\n  - http.uri\n  - http.method\n  - http.status_code\n  - http.user_agent\n  \n"
  - question: Are multiple external clients receiving 403 responses from this server?
    context: Determines if this is isolated client behavior or broader access control enforcement.
    range: +/-24h
    query: "aggregation: false\nlogsource:\n  category: network\n  service: http\ndetection:\n  selection:\n    dst_ip: '{source.ip}'\n    dst_port: '{source.port}'\n    http.status_code: \"403\"\n  condition: selection\nfields:\n  - src_ip\n  - http.uri\n  - http.user_agent\n  - http.method\n  \n"
  - question: What user agent is this client using for the denied requests?
    context: Identifies if the client is using automated tools or browsers for access attempts.
    range: +/-1h
    query: "aggregation: false\nlogsource:\n  category: network\n  service: http\ndetection:\n  selection:\n    src_ip: '{destination.ip}'\n    dst_ip: '{source.ip}'\n  condition: selection\nfields:\n  - http.user_agent\n  - http.uri\n  - http.method\n  - http.status_code\n  \n"
  - question: Is this client attempting to access administrative or sensitive directories?
    context: Reveals if access denials are for protected resources like admin panels or configuration files.
    range: +/-2h
    query: "aggregation: false\nlogsource:\n  category: network\n  service: http\ndetection:\n  selection:\n    src_ip: '{destination.ip}'\n    dst_ip: '{source.ip}'\n  admin_paths:\n    http.uri|contains:\n      - admin\n      - administrator\n      - wp-admin\n      - phpmyadmin\n      - config\n      - backup\n      - private\n      - secure\n  condition: selection and admin_paths\nfields:\n  - http.uri\n  - http.method\n  - http.status_code\n  \n"
  - question: What is the timing pattern of requests from this client?
    context: Identifies if requests follow automated scanning patterns or manual browsing behavior.
    range: +/-1h

      aggregation: false
      logsource:
        category: network

        - server.ip_bytes
        - connection.state_description
  - question: Are other hosts on the same network attempting similar access?
    context: Determines if this is part of coordinated reconnaissance from the same network.
    range: +/-6h
