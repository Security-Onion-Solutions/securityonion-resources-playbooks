  - question: What other RPC services were queried from the same source?
    context: Identifies whether this is part of broader RPC service enumeration activity.

  - question: What portmapper service is running on the target host?
    context: Identifies the RPC service configuration and available endpoints.
    range: +/-15m
    query: "aggregation: false\nlogsource:\n  category: process_creation\ndetection:\n  selection:\n    host.ip: '{destination.ip}'\n    Image|contains:\n      - \"portmap\"\n      - \"rpcbind\"\n      - \"rpc.portmap\"\n  condition: selection\nfields:\n  - Image\n  - CommandLine\n  - User\n  - ProcessGuid\n  \n"
