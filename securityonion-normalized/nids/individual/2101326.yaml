name: GPL SHELLCODE ssh CRC32 overflow NOOP
id: 1248896
description: |
  Detects SSH connections containing repeating NOP (0x90) byte sequences that may indicate buffer overflow exploitation attempts.
  May trigger on legitimate binary data transfers or specific SSH implementations with unusual padding patterns.
