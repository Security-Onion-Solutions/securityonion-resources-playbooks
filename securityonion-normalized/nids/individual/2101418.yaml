questions:
  - question: What was the complete SNMP request that triggered this alert?
    context: Understanding the full SNMP request reveals the specific query and community string used.
    range: +/-15m
    query: "aggregation: false\nlogsource:\n  category: network\n  service: \ndetection:\n  selection:\n    community_id: '{network.community_id}'\n  condition: selection\nfields:\n  - src_ip\n  - dst_ip\n  - dst_port"
  - question: Does this host normally receive external SNMP requests?
    context: Determines if external SNMP access to this device is typical for network management.
