name: GPL SNMP community string buffer overflow attempt with evasion
id: 1248735
description: |
  Detects SNMP community string buffer overflow attempts using specific byte patterns that may indicate exploitation attempts.
  May trigger on legitimate SNMP traffic with large community strings or network monitoring tools performing SNMP discovery.
