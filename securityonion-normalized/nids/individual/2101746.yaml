name: GPL RPC portmap cachefsd request UDP
id: 1228365
description: |
  Detects UDP requests to the RPC portmap service (port 111) that contain patterns matching cachefsd service requests.
  May indicate legitimate RPC service discovery or potential exploitation of CVE-2002-0033/CVE-2002-0084 vulnerabilities.
