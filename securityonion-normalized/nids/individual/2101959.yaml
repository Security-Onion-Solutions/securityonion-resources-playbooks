name: GPL RPC portmap NFS request UDP
id: 1228351
description: |
  Detects UDP requests to the RPC portmapper service (port 111) specifically requesting NFS service information.
  Common during legitimate network discovery, system administration, and NFS client operations, but may indicate reconnaissance activity.
