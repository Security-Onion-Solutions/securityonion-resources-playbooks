name: GPL EXPLOIT EIGRP prefix length overflow attempt
id: 1248745
description: |
  Detects EIGRP packets with prefix length values exceeding 32, indicating potential buffer overflow exploitation.
  May trigger on malformed EIGRP packets from network devices with configuration errors or legitimate routing updates with unusual prefix lengths.
