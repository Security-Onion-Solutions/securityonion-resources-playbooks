name: GPL WEB_CLIENT bitmap BitmapOffset integer overflow attempt
id: 1249037
description: |
  Detects BMP files with malformed BitmapOffset values that could trigger integer overflow vulnerabilities in web browsers or image processing libraries.
  May trigger on legitimate corrupted BMP files or security research tools testing image parsing libraries.
