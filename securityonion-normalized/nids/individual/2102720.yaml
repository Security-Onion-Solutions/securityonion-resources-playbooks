name: GPL SQL dbms_repcat.add_column_group_to_flavor buffer overflow attempt
id: 1227274
description: |
  Detects Oracle SQL requests to dbms_repcat.add_column_group_to_flavor with unusually long parameters that may indicate buffer overflow exploitation attempts.
  May trigger on legitimate Oracle replication procedures with large parameter values or database administration activities.
