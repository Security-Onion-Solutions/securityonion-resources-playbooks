name: GPL SQL dbms_repcat.comment_on_unique_resolution buffer overflow attempt
id: 1227291
description: |
  Detects Oracle SQL requests targeting dbms_repcat.comment_on_unique_resolution with excessively long parameters that may indicate buffer overflow exploitation attempts.
  May trigger on legitimate Oracle database administration activities or automated tools performing schema replication operations.
