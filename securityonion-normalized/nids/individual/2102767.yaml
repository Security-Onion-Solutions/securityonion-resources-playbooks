name: GPL SQL dbms_repcat.drop_delete_resolution buffer overflow attempt
id: 1227300
description: |
  Detects Oracle PL/SQL calls to dbms_repcat.drop_delete_resolution with oversized parameters that may indicate buffer overflow exploitation attempts.
  May trigger on legitimate database operations with large parameter values or database administration scripts.
