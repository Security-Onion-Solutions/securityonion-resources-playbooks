name: GPL SQL dbms_repcat.execute_ddl buffer overflow attempt
id: 1227310
description: |
  Detects Oracle SQL commands targeting dbms_repcat.execute_ddl with oversized parameters that may indicate buffer overflow exploitation attempts.
  May trigger on legitimate database administration activities or applications using large parameter values in Oracle replication procedures.
