name: GPL SQL sys.dbms_repcat_sna_utl.switch_snapshot_master buffer overflow attempt
id: 1247920
description: |
  Detects Oracle SQL queries targeting sys.dbms_repcat_sna_utl.switch_snapshot_master with unusually long parameters that may indicate buffer overflow exploitation attempts.
  May also trigger on legitimate database administration involving snapshot management with long parameter values.
