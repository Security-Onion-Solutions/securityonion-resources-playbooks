name: GPL NETBIOS SMB nddeapi andx bind attempt
id: 1227645
description: |
  Detects SMB protocol attempts to bind to the nddeapi service, which can be used for legitimate DDE operations or potential exploitation.
  May trigger on normal network administration tools or legacy applications using DDE communication.
