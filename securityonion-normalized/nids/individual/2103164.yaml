name: GPL NETBIOS SMB msqueue andx bind attempt
id: 1227629
description: |
  Detects attempts to bind to the MSQUEUE service over SMB, which could indicate legitimate queue operations or exploitation attempts targeting CVE-2003-0995.
  This activity may be normal in environments using message queuing services or could represent reconnaissance or exploitation.
