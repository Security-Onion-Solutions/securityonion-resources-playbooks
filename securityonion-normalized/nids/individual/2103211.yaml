name: GPL NETBIOS SMB-DS winreg little endian bind attempt
id: 1227608
description: |
  Detects SMB connections attempting to bind to the Windows Registry service (winreg) over SMB.
  May indicate legitimate remote registry access or administrative tools, but could also suggest
  reconnaissance or lateral movement attempts targeting registry information.
