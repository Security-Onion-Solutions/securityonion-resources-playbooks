questions:

  - question: What file creation event triggered this alert?
    context: |
      Review the filename, location, and extension to help confirm the legitimacy of the file creation.
    answer_sources:
      - alert
    query: |
      aggregation: false
      logsource:
        category: alert

        selection:
          document_id: '{soc_id}'
        condition: selection
      fields:
        - hostname
        - User
        - file.path

  - question: What process created this file?
    context: |
      Reviewing the process and command line provides additional context. Pivoting off the ProcessGuid
      will show the full process chain leading to the file creation.

  - question: Is the file location and type expected for the executable?
    context: |
      Certain executables should only write to specific directories. Unusual locations can indicate malicious activity. This query
      shows the historical pattern of file creation by this executable on this system.

  - question: What is the historical pattern of file creation by this executable?
    context: |
      Understanding normal file creation patterns helps identify anomalous behavior.

        condition: selection
      fields:
        - TargetFilename

  - question: Is this file creation associated with scheduled maintenance or admin tasks?
    context: |
      Many file operations occur during legitimate maintenance windows or administrative activities.

        - Image
        - TargetFilename

  - question: What other files were created by this process in the same timeframe?
    context: |
      Multiple file creations can reveal patterns like data staging, malware installation, or batch operations.
    range: +/-5m

        condition: selection
      fields:
        - TargetFilename

  - question: Were any processes spawned from the created file location?
    context: |
      Execution from newly created files can indicate malware drops or persistence mechanisms.
    range: +15m

  - question: Are other hosts showing similar file creation patterns?
    context: |
      Widespread file creation across multiple systems may indicate deployment, malware spread, or policy changes.
