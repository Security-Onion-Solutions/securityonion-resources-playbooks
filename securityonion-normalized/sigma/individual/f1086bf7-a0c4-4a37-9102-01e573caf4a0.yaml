name: "Renamed Whoami Execution Investigation"
id: 1500002
description: |
  Investigation playbook for analyzing the execution of a renamed whoami.exe binary. This technique is commonly used by 
  attackers and malware to evade detection while performing system reconnaissance. By renaming the legitimate whoami utility, 
  attackers attempt to bypass security controls and blend malicious activity with normal system operations. This detection 
  identifies discrepancies between the original filename embedded in the PE header and the actual running process name, 
  which is a strong indicator of evasion attempts or malware obfuscation techniques.
